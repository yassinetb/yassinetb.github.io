        <h1>Interesting Content of 2025</h1>
        <p>I often read cool articles, watch documentaries or movies. But they might not be great enough for me to add on my "Internet Favorites" section. So here they are, as well as some personal notes on them. 
        <br /><br />
        Who knows - maybe your mind is currently open for some fascination? Maybe you'll find something here...</p>

 * [The story of Attention Is All You Need](https://www.wired.com/story/eight-google-employees-invented-modern-ai-transformers-paper/). 
    * Very cool story - fascinating to hear about how it took years for the idea to come into what it got to.
    * Interesting to reflect over the failure of Google to take advantage of this technology - that was built in house.
    * A good reminder that a revolution starts from nothing. It only takes a few visionaries. More and more, it only takes a few nerds writing a couple hundred lines of code, and being at the right place at the right time. 

* [Maybe ESG is Illegal Now](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-14/maybe-esg-is-illegal-now)
    * If you don't know it already, anything this guy writes is just amazing. Subscribe today to his newsletter... 
    * This one was particularly good. Just straight up extraordinary to think that Federal Judges can do such crazy things, that completely omit the reality - to pass anti-climate bills.

* [Jerry Seinfeld on The Tim Ferris Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4h8qKSlDbewofkxq6HsVaX?si=wmE0117CTGeYrjehU7c0AA&t=709) 
    * This one is pure gold. Hearing about Jerry Seinfeld's writing discipline is just phenomenal. A few takeaways from this: 
    * He sits down every day, for ~4 hours, with a pen and a "yellow legal notebook", and forces himself to write. No distractions, nothing else - just him, the notebook and the pen. He is not allowed to do anything else for these 4 hours, and if he cannot write anything, so be it - he still has to stay staring at the notebook for these 4 hours. It's about the discipline of showing up every day. 
    * He really thinks about writing in two ways - the creative way, and the disciplined way. He consciously alternates between these two phases. The creative one is just about raw ideas that are super interesting but not thought through, and which *shouldn't* be thought through. The second *disciplined* phase is cleaning up and expandign on the creative phase. 
    * A good follow up is the excellent review of his methods by [David Perell](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4CvrNvOonv0rv1yt85gwRb?si=shJ3kyg9RWakrmE_APr8FQ&t=1105): 
   
* [200 Billion Weights of Responsibility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aEdTE-B6CSPPeUWYD-IgNVQVZM25f7MF-u9qn5KJJvo/edit?tab=t.0)
    * Author talks about the stress of AI research in recent history - and everything he writes down is spot on accurate. 
    * I can particularly relate to the "No Role For Scientist" section - it's so hard today for academic research to have any sort of impact in this field. Engineering at max level of data and compute is what wins. The Bitter Lesson all over again...
    * The author unfortunately committed suicide...
