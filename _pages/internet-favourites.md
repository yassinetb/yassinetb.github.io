        <h1>Internet Favourites</h1>
        <p>Sometimes I stumble upon some stuff on the internet that just deeply impacts. Could be a Youtube video, an article, a Reddit Thread. Often, these are things I would like to pledge to get back to at least once a year - to keep me in check whenever in need. These are listed on this page. It's in no particular order - if at some point it gets too long, I should sort them by themes - feel free to harass me to get that done.</p>

* [Something Left Unsaid - Lyle Mays Interview](https://www.lylemays.com/something-left-unsaid). This one really shook me for some reason, so much wisdom in it about his vision of the music industry and the process of creativity - of course, it can extend to so many different fields. I really went through a hardcore Lyle Mays phase - this was after I saw Pat Metheny's concerts in Montreux - I of course was completely mindblown, started digging and found out the extent of Myle's Genius.   

* [Universal Mind of Bill Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwXAqIaUahI&t=386s) This shook my world when I first saw this in my teens. It still leaves me inspired everytime I hear it.

* [You and Your Research - Richard Hamming](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html). Read this from a recommendation by Jimmy before the start of my PhD. Inspiring read that one should go back to very frequently while conductin research. 

* [The Bitter Lessons - Richard Sutton](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) Gotta love the plain HTML of this article - somewhat funny given the topic. Every scientist should read this - especially anyone interested in computing. This is what made me understand that Neuromorphic Engineering, as fascinating and beautiful as it was, wasn't gonna make the cut.  

* [Lennie Tristano - Tangerine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGLpczTtnEM) Look at that left hand... Oh and he's blind, of course. 

* [Demis Hassabis Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X7Koxx4qJE&list=FLVEGJyKdX1f_76VaLu_Viig&index=42) Demis is cool. Demis is very cool. This interview is a great one. 

* [The Language of The New Music - Wittgenstein & Schoenberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRI_ZSh6iF4&list=FLVEGJyKdX1f_76VaLu_Viig&index=71) This started my Wittgenstein obsession phase. I'm glad it ended though.
