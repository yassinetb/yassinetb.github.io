* **The Latent Potential of Bamboo**

Bamboos, when first planted, don't see light of day for months. They just ignore the urge to grow high to instead, quietly, focus on building deep invisible roots. Building these roots requires a great deal of care, and, more importantly, patience. Indeed, patience—because, after months of quiet and unrecognized effort, spring eventually kicks in, and bamboos suddenly begin to grow. And when they do, they really do - all at once, at an astonishing rate, sometimes up to a meter per day.

Too often, our daily efforts are unrewarded - as we push forward, frustration and doubt deepen, and corrupt our will to continue the daily work. But we must have faith in the value of our quiet invisible work and internalize the concept of “latent potential”. Each unrecognized step strengthens our foundations and individuality, which only need the right spark to suddenly, burst out and shine into the world - all at once.

Continue building your potential, even when the results aren’t immediate, but don't forget to put yourself out into the world, seeking your own “spring.” The breakthrough often comes from a single, unexpected moment, which could never have led to anything without all the quiet work you did.

* **"*If everyone did their best, everyone would have enough*"**

It is so curious that us humans haven't collectively internalized this old and cheap trick to happiness. This trick - it not only brings joy to the ticker, but also to the tricked, and to everyone who witnesses the trick. It is so simple, so innocent - so unnecessary. 

This is maybe what makes it so magical - it is profoundly unnecessary. Uncalled for. Uninterested. Perhaps most importantly, it is unexpected.

*Random acts of kindness*. They can come in all forms and shapes, but they always, *always*, bring joy on the face of its initiator - and to everyone who is there to witness it. Most curiously, the joy is so pure, so candid, that it seamlessly turns into lasting happiness. 

I often recall the smile on the face of a man for whom I stopped my car at the pedestrian crossing in the middle of Casablanca - where no car ever stops at pedestrian crossing. The surprise and confusion on his face: "are you really stopping for me?" he seemed to think, while a beautiful smile was building up on his face. Weeks later, I still remember his smile, and it still makes *me* smile. 

Imagine a world all of us showed kindness to our neighbors, every day. Taking 10 seconds of our days to bring a genuine smile to someone who does not expect it.
