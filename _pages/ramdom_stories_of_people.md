        <h1>Random People Doing Random Things</h1>
        <p>Sometimes I stumble upon things on the internet that deeply fascinate me. I always feel an urge to share them with my friends - and often feel disappointed with underwhelming reactions. I've now made peace with the fact that every mind is different - what resonates with me often won't resonate with my friends in the same way, or at least, not at the same time. In the end, our fascination for something is less dependant on its quality than it is dependant on our (unconscious) openness to it at a given time. Oh and that applies to people too. 
        <br /><br />
        Who knows - maybe your mind is currently open for some fascination? Maybe you'll find something here...</p>

* [Something Left Unsaid - Lyle Mays Interview](https://www.lylemays.com/something-left-unsaid). This one really shook me for some reason, so much wisdom in it about his vision of the music industry and the process of creativity - of course, it can extend to so many different fields. I really went through a hardcore Lyle Mays phase - this was after I saw Pat Metheny's concerts in Montreux - I of course was completely mindblown, started digging and found out the extent of Myle's Genius.
