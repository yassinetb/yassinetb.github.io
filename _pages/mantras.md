* Stagnation is the beginning of downfall. 
* Whatever you are waiting for to "finally be happy" won't make you happy when you eventually get it. 
* It's easier to hold onto your values and principles 100% of the times than 99% of the times. Saying yes "*just once*" also tends to have a compounding effect.  
* Life is short - choose the uncertain and risky path, and make it work somehow.  
* Choose to see the good in people. Try to always find *one* good thing about them. Tell it to them. It will both empower them, and make them respect you. 
* One likes *because*. One loves *despite*. 
* The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time to plant the tree is today.
* The world is a museum of passion projects. [John Collison](https://twitter.com/collision/status/1529452415346302976)
* Love bites, always. But true, selfless love is the only meaningful pursuit in one's life.  
* Some people are born to live the life of the year they bear, other make years bear the life they live. (Anas)  
* People are born with certain talents, at various levels of it. No amount of education can overcome natural talent. Education and training can take you very far, almost always further away than lazy talented people, but you can never learn talent and intuition. Find your talents, and exploit them. 
* The capacity to name things is no reflection of understanding - but it fools a lot of people into thinking you understand: be aware of what game you are trying to win.  
* The people around you are the most important influence on your life.
* Knowing how to navigate social settings, make friends and appear smart and knowledgeable is a very important skill one ought to master.
* Only ask favours from people who have no one to punish them if they get caught. As such, never trust HR at your company. 
* When there is no way to know the truth, one must simply choose their truth. [Anatomie d'une chute](https://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=297303.html)
* People whom are hyper socially competent - socialites - are a pain in the ass. Mastering a non-social-centric craft is a great testimony of intellectual honesty and integrity.
