Hi! I am Yassine – born and raised in sunny and beautiful Morocco.

I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Benjamin Grewe](https://grewelab.org/biography/) at the Institute of Neuroinformatics, ETH Zurich. I am particularly interested in the topics of Neuro-Symbolic AI, Generalization, and Interpretibility and Safety. I also work on the [ARC Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge), which I started investigating during my Master’s thesis. You can work with me by browsing through my [open projects](/projects/) or by [contacting me]({{ site.email | prepend: 'mailto:' }}) . 

I sometimes give [talks](/talks/) about my research and related topics. I also frequently teach programming and machine learning to teens and adults, and very much enjoy it. I particularly enjoy creating fun teaching material, and telling funny dad jokes while presenting ideas I'm passionate about.  

I have been blessed with the love of music (not so much with talent for it, but never mind that). I play piano in a few musical projects around Zurich, mainly playing Jazz, Funk and occasionally classical. I hold a particular love for the universe of Opera and Orchestral Music, which pushed me to pick up orchestral conducting in my London days. I have had the chance to form a small ensemble - the Boyce Camerata - with whom I gave several concerts in different London venues.

When I'm not doing science or music, you can find me reading literature, running around Zurich, writing some [random thoughts](/blog/), and making fun of my Italian flatmates in their own language.
