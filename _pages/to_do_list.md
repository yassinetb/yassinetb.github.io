- [ ] Add a "My Friends On The News" section to brag about the achievements of my friends.
- [ ] Add some kind of subscription for the blog 
- [ ] Expand the "Internet Favourites" section, and most importantly, enable users to sort by Tag, or maybe by date at which I added it. I think this would be cool if the section gets bigger. 
- [ ] Fix SEO of my blog.
- [ ] Add a subscribe section for my blog or for news. 
- [ ] Add a likes/comments options for the blogposts. 
- [ ] Add a full CV. To be honest I'm not quite sure I want to do that. Maybe I will. Let's see. 
- [x] Fix links to the blog posts.
- [ ] Add a music section.
