        <h1>Internet Favourites</h1>
        <p>Sometimes I stumble upon things on the internet that deeply fascinate me. I always feel an urge to share them with my friends - and often feel disappointed with underwhelming reactions. I've now made peace with the fact that every mind is different - what resonates with me often won't resonate with my friends in the same way, or at least, not at the same time. In the end, our fascination for something is less dependant on its quality than it is dependant on our (unconscious) openness to it at a given time. Oh and that applies to people too. 
        <br /><br />
        Who knows - maybe your mind is currently open for some fascination? Maybe you'll find something here...</p>

* [Something Left Unsaid - Lyle Mays Interview](https://www.lylemays.com/something-left-unsaid). This one really shook me for some reason, so much wisdom in it about his vision of the music industry and the process of creativity - of course, it can extend to so many different fields. I really went through a hardcore Lyle Mays phase - this was after I saw Pat Metheny's concerts in Montreux - I of course was completely mindblown, started digging and found out the extent of Myle's Genius.   

* [Universal Mind of Bill Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwXAqIaUahI&t=386s) This shook my world when I first saw this in my teens. It still leaves me inspired everytime I hear it.

* [Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268). Easily one of my top 5 favourite papers of all time. The idea is so obvious yet so clever: could we use modern Neuroscience methodologies to understand a known "complex-distributed system": a microprocessor. Turns out that (rather unsurprisingly if you asked me) - modern Neuroscience techniques (connectomics, ablation studies etc...) are rather poor tools to get good insights into how a microprocess works. Surely they must better suited to understand the brain - a orders-of-magnitude more compelx system? Lol.

* [You and Your Research - Richard Hamming](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html). Read this from a recommendation by Jimmy before the start of my PhD. Inspiring read that one should go back to very frequently while conductin research. 

* [Neural Network Training Makes Beautiful Fractals](https://sohl-dickstein.github.io/2024/02/12/fractal.html) A beautiful short piece of work where the author performed a grid search over learning rates for a very simple network. The results is some absolutely fantastic fractal visuals of hyperparameter space convergence/divergence. Indeed, this is not so surprising - after all - "Both [fractals and DNNs] involve repeatedly applying a function to its own output. In both cases, that function has hyperparameters that control its behavior. In both cases the repeated function application can produce outputs that either diverge to infinity or remain happily bounded depending on those hyperparameters." Obvious - isn't it? 

* [Nadia Boulanger - Par Bruno Monsaingeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLlHtCttSE8) Easily the most influential piano teacher of the past century, this documentary, by the fantastic Bruno Monsaigeon pictures her as well as many of her great students discussing music, and showcasing her genius. 

* [Sviatosalav Richter - Par Bruno Monsaingeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNmb7It0G7c) A documentary that's very dear to me on Richter, one of my all time favourite artists. 

* [The Bitter Lessons - Richard Sutton](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) Gotta love the plain HTML of this article - somewhat funny given the topic. Every scientist should read this - especially anyone interested in computing. This is what made me understand that Neuromorphic Engineering, as fascinating and beautiful as it was, wasn't gonna make the cut.  

* [The Coffe-House of Surat - Leo Tolstoy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/tolstoy/1893/the-coffeehouse-of-surat.html). A short "coffee-house chat" written by Tolstoy, where everyone talks about why their religion is the best one. You've guessed it, no one manages to convince anyone else - but they do find some form of (unexpected)agreement in the end...  

* [Lennie Tristano - Tangerine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGLpczTtnEM) Look at that left hand... Oh and he's blind, of course. 

* [Tantacrul: The Battle for how We Read Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq3bUFgEcb4&t=951s) Excellent "documentary-movie" (yes I wouldn't call this a "Youtube video") on the history and evolution of music notation. 

* [The Language of The New Music - Wittgenstein & Schoenberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRI_ZSh6iF4&list=FLVEGJyKdX1f_76VaLu_Viig&index=71) This started my Wittgenstein obsession phase. I'm glad it ended though. 

* [Why I'm Awlays Late - Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/07/why-im-always-late.html) A classic essay - the first one I ever read from Tim Urban.
