Employers either hire PhD graduates expecting incredible performance and quality of work on all aspects, or don’t even bother hiring them because they are “over-qualified”, “overly theoretical”, and “disconnected from reality”.</p> <p>I think this is all a bit like trying to drink soup with a fork - it certainly won’t work, but that doesn’t mean the fork can never be useful.</p> <p>In this post, I try to tell you about what forks can be used for, what different types of forks exist, and how to pick the best one for your needs.</p> <h2 id="what-are-phd-students-good-and-bad-at">What Are PhD Students good (and bad) at?</h2> <p>Every PhD student goes through a unique path to graduate - influenced by the working environment, their supervisors, the project/field they are working on, and their own personality. To understand what a PhD can be good at, it’s important to investigate key aspects of a PhD journey.</p> <p>So what should you try to dig into to understand what the PhD student you have in front of you is made of?</p> <h3 id="phd-idiosyncrasy-1---finding-a-niche">PhD idiosyncrasy 1 - Finding a Niche</h3> <p><strong>Why is this super important within a PhD</strong></p> <p>The greatest challenge of a PhD is to find a niche to work on and contribute to. Finding that niche, that research question, is often significantly harder than finding the answer. The space of possibilities, the existing literature… it’s just so all vast and endless… One needs to fully integrate and balance 1) their ambitions, expertise, weaknesses, 2) the state-of-the-art of their field, and 3) the realities and resources of people they work, all into a cohesive direction to have maximal impact without suffering too much.</p> <p>It’s very unlike the corporate world where it is permissible to have two companies doing exactly the same thing and competing against one another. The great ambition of the researcher is to be unique, to bring radically novel ideas to the community <d-footnote>Wink Wink Jurgen Schmidhuber </d-footnote>. This is also the great peril of the academic - by being obsessed with being novel and unique, they often risk locking themselves in territories only relevant to their own self.</p> <p>The great challenge of the PhD student is to find that one north star in their research, that guides them to work on ideas they can pursue better than anyone else, but which are also interesting to other humans.</p> <p><strong>The different styles of doing it</strong></p> <p>Broadly, there are two ways through which PhD students build their research. In each case, the student is lost in some way.</p> <ol> <li> <strong>PhD 1: Lost in a Sports Pitch:</strong> The supervisor already has a <strong>clear</strong> idea of what they want to student to do <d-footnote>In my lab, we often speak of "Supervisor-2-real-gap", to signify the gap between what a supervisor thinks is feasible vs what is actually feasible. So I insist on **clear** here - some supervisors really know well what they want and how to achieve it, and some only have a broad idea. The latter category lead to experience # 2. </d-footnote>, and the students don’t really have to investigate much besides putting to reality the ideas of the supervisor, and adding their own spice to it. These PhD experiences are a bit like experiences of expert athletes - in need of becoming the best of the bests at that one specific sport in which pitch they happened to have gotten stuck in. They need the best sports coach and training-mates in town, as well as great resources and equipment to be competitive. It’s hard in its own way.</li> <li> <strong>PhD 2: Lost in the Ocean</strong>: The supervisor only has a <strong>loose</strong> idea of what they want the student to do, leaving it up to the students to determine the specific direction of their research. In this case, the challenge shifts entirely—it’s about finding land before you run out of energy. One knows they can reach land by swimming in any direction, but some paths are longer, some are stormier, and some are filled with sharks. You must feel the Ocean, ask nearby swimmers how they chose their direction, then decide on your own, commit, and keep swimming. It’s not about getting there faster than everyone else (like PhD 1), but about the story of how you reached land, and the critical things you learned along the way about the Ocean - that everyone can learn something from.</li> </ol> <p><strong>How can you leverage this knowledge in your company</strong></p> <p>Well, the first thing you should do is to try to understand how the PhD applicants found their research path. How they took risks, how they played things safe, how they made things work when it was not going well. Get them to describe it in as much depth as possible - you’ll find a myriad of stories that will shine great light into the personality of the applicant.</p> <p>Some will have gone through experience 1 but felt suffocated by it, and some will have gone through experience 2 and enjoyed the struggle of it all. These ones you may want to give bigger projects to, longer term ideas that need deep thinking and slow refinement.</p> <p>Others will have gone through experience 2 but almost failed to make it to land, or gone through experience 1 and did great in that setting. These ones, you should give clear directions to, and shorter term, tangible goals.</p> <p>In all cases, by discussing these issues, you should get a queue of whether your applicant is driven by big questions, the kind that can make an industry shift in a different direction, or if they are driven by solving one little problem after another - and getting things done well.</p> <p>At the end of the day, the real superpower that all PhD student must acquire is the ability to find that niche and exploit it well. Most employers see the hyperspecialization of PhD graduates as a problem, because the niche doesn’t translate well to “real world” needs - but that completely omits the process through which they went through to actually hyperspecialize. If you know how to do things well, you can work with them to find a new unexplored niche within your industry, and get them to find insights, and work on things that no one else has found before.</p> <h3 id="phd-idiosyncrasy-2---framing-the-niche">PhD idiosyncrasy 2 - Framing the niche</h3> <p><strong>Why is this super important within a PhD</strong></p> <p>“Creatives have two masters: the art and the medium. Only serve the art, and you won’t find an audience. Only serve the medium, and your work will lose its soul. It’s the dance between them that makes a successful creative.” <d-footnote> Quote by the wonderful David Perell" </d-footnote>.</p> <p>PhD students must communicate their research - they must publish papers, go to conferences, discuss it with peers, and get their work out. It’s also the way for them to meet people to work with, but more on that later. The way they do is extremely individual, and can show a lot about their way of doing things.</p> <p><strong>The different styles of doing it</strong></p> <p>“PhD students suck at writing the first two pages of a papers” <d-footnote>From a coffee chat conversation with Prof. Thilo Stadelmann </d-footnote>.</p> <p>PhD students are often fantastic appendix writers - writing these long memos that almost no one will read but are technically very precise and are the foundations the ideas are. Often, these PhD students will also be horrible at writing an introduction (the first two pages of the paper) - where one must contextualize within the literature, and dream big about the potential impact and outlook of the science. This can be <strong>by design</strong>, i.e. the given student is not good at contextualizing, or <strong>circumstantial</strong>, i.e. the student is so deep into the science that they haven’t had the chance to reflect on it in a long time.</p> <p>Sometimes it will be the other way around - some PhDs are very good at story telling and contextualization and not so good at the details. This is more rare though.</p> <p>If you are lucky, you find someone who can do both - they exist. In any case, you should figure out what is it they’re good at.</p> <p><strong>How can you leverage this knowledge in your company</strong></p> <p>Spend time investigating how they write, and how they communicate their work - even if you don’t understand it, you should be able to get the info of what was their preferred mode of functioning.</p> <h3 id="phd-idiosyncrasy-3---collaborating-within-your-niche">PhD Idiosyncrasy 3 - Collaborating within your niche</h3> <h2 id="interview-questions-to-ask-a-phd-graduate">Interview questions to ask a PhD Graduate</h2> <h3 id="what-was-your-favorite-paper-and-why">What was your favorite paper, and why?</h3> <p>This is a great question to understand what the PhD graduate in front of you finds beauty and passion in - what they look up to. I think this is super important to understand a person - understanding what they admire and why they admire it. I remember asking a dear-to-my heart Oncologist about her favorite paper. She mentioned an opinion paper <d-footnote> https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7671 </d-footnote> from an Oncologist, whose own son had died from Cancer at 10 years old. He reflected in this short opinion paper about this taught him of his experience being on the other side of the table - and how it humbled him to be a better doctor. I learned a lot about this person from that answer.</p> <p>A lot of students don’t have a favorite paper, nor can they even think of a paper they really liked. To me that’s a pretty strong indicator that I might not want to work with this person - how do you spend 3-6 years of your life doing something, reading and writing papers, and not having one paper that actually strongly impacted you in some way?</p> <h3 id="how-was-your-relationship-with-your-supervisor-what-were-their-strength-and-weaknesses">How was your relationship with your supervisor? What were their strength and weaknesses?</h3> <p>We all have been asked the infamous question “what your strengths and weaknesses” in interviews. And we all agree this question is not a good proxy for figuring out the answer to the question. Instead, I believe a great question is to ask about the strengths and weaknesses of the PhD supervisor of the candidate. There are two reasons for this:</p> <ol> <li>Most often, asking person X about another person Y’s strengths and weaknesses is actually the best way to find out about X’s strengths and weaknesses. People often look up to things that they wish they were better at, and find weaknesses out of things they feel they are better at themselves.</li> <li>No PhD student is indifferent to their advisor. The relationships are very often complex, difficult, changing in time, and source of tension. It’s a very good way to figure out the value system of the students - both through what worked with the supervisor, and what they wished had worked better. It’s also a good way to figure out what to expect from working with someone - will they be needy or independent? Will they be confident (even arrogant) or will they need constant support to shine?</li> </ol> <h3 id="who-has-been-the-most-important-person-to-the-success-of-your-phd-and-why">Who has been the most important person to the success of your PhD, and why?</h3> <p>In a similar spirit to the question about papers, but people oriented this time. A PhD is not completed alone - many people are instrumental in reaching the finish line. Some people who inspired you, guided you, picked you up when you were lost, or simply were present and brought you some joy every day to keep pushing. PhDs are often very lonely - but reflecting over the people whom were important to their success will tell you about the kind of human support and inspiration they need.</p> <h3 id="not-a-question-rather-an-obligation---read-the-thesis-of-your-interviewee">Not a question, rather an obligation - Read the thesis of your interviewee.</h3> <p>No need to read it all, but you should at least skim through it. It will immediately become clear how your student thinks and what they are naturally comfortable in doing. There often are no clear guidelines on how to write a PhD thesis - thus making students go rather freestyle on their writing. Some will put a lot of effort into it, some won’t. Some will write lenghty and accessible introductions, with fantastic contextualization and perspective, and some will uniquely focus on the “meat” of their science and write lengthy pages of proofs and technical perspectives.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Yassine Taoudi-Benchekroun.
