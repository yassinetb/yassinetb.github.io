## Collaboration

If you are a Ph.D student, postdoc or else, and you'd like to work with me, I'm very open to chatting and figuring out something together! Please [reach out]({{ site.email | prepend: 'mailto:' }})  :)  

## Supervision

If you are a Bachelor or Master student and you'd like to do a short project or thesis with me (which you'd get ECTS credits for), I'm open to chatting and figuring out something. Feel free to browse through the list of <a href="/open-projects">open projects</a>, or even to suggest a project that you think I could do a good job at supervising.

I am happy to try supervising any students enrolled in universities (anywhere in the world) currently pursuing a science/engineering degree. You will however need to fill me in on your administrative side of things, and I will see what I can do to get you onboard at my home department - the Institute of Neuroinformatics. We normally cannot pay students, nor for their work, nor for eventual travel expenses. 

To apply, [email me]({{ site.email | prepend: 'mailto:' }}) along with a short description of your interest in the project as well as a CV, transcript and a GitHub repo so I can have a look at how you code.
