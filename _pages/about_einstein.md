Hi! I am Yassine – born and raised in the sunny and beautiful Morocco.

Since early 2024, I started a PhD under the supervision of Prof. Benjamin Grewe, where I divide my attention between the topics of Neuro-Symbolic AI, Open-Ended Learning, and AI reliability. I also work on the [ARC Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge), which I started investigating during my Master’s thesis.

I frequently teach programming and machine learning to young students, and very much enjoy it. I particularly enjoy creating fun teaching material, and telling dad jokes to kids.  

In previous professional & academic lives, I have been a Neural Systems Computation master student at ETH/UZH (2021-2023); a tech project manager for a Moroccan company (2021); a (proudly) failed startup-er (2020), a Machine Learning Engineer at a maritime data analysis company (2019-2020), and a Biomedical Engineer bachelor student at King’s College London (2016-2019).

I have been blessed with the love of music (not so much with talent for it, but never mind that). I currently play piano in a few musical projects around Zurich, mainly playing Jazz, Funk and occasionally classical. I hold a particular love for the universe of Opera and Orchestral Music, which pushed me to pick up orchestral conducting in my London days. I have had the chance to form a small ensemble - the Boyce Camerata - with whom I gave 3 concerts in different London venues.
