        Who knows - maybe your mind is currently open for some fascination? Maybe you'll find something here...</p>

* [Jerry Seinfeld on The Tim Ferris Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4h8qKSlDbewofkxq6HsVaX?si=wmE0117CTGeYrjehU7c0AA&t=709) *January 13th 2024*
    * This one is pure gold. Hearing about Jerry Seinfeld's writing discipline is just phenomenal. A few takeaways from this: 
    * He sits down every day, for ~4 hours, with a pen and a "yellow legal notebook", and forces himself to write. No distractions, nothing else - just him, the notebook and the pen. He is not allowed to do anything else for these 4 hours, and if he cannot write anything, so be it - he still has to stay staring at the notebook for these 4 hours. It's about the discipline of showing up every day. 
    * He really thinks about writing in two ways - the creative way, and the disciplined way. He consciously alternates between these two phases. The creative one is just about raw ideas that are super interesting but not thought through, and which *shouldn't* be thought through. The second *disciplined* phase is cleaning up and expanding on the creative phase. 
    * A good follow up is the excellent review of his methods by [David Perell](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4CvrNvOonv0rv1yt85gwRb?si=shJ3kyg9RWakrmE_APr8FQ&t=1105): 

 * [The story of Attention Is All You Need](https://www.wired.com/story/eight-google-employees-invented-modern-ai-transformers-paper/). *January 17th 2024*
    * Very cool story - fascinating to hear about how it took years for the idea to come into what it got to.
    * Interesting to reflect over the failure of Google to take advantage of this technology - that was built in house.
    * A good reminder that a revolution starts from nothing. It only takes a few visionaries. More and more, it only takes a few nerds writing a couple hundred lines of code, and being at the right place at the right time. 

* [Maybe ESG is Illegal Now](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-14/maybe-esg-is-illegal-now) *January 17th 2024*
    * If you don't know it already, anything this guy writes is just amazing. Subscribe today to his newsletter... 
    * This one was particularly good. Just straight up extraordinary to think that Federal Judges can do such crazy things, that completely omit the reality - to pass anti-climate bills.

* [200 Billion Weights of Responsibility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aEdTE-B6CSPPeUWYD-IgNVQVZM25f7MF-u9qn5KJJvo/edit?tab=t.0) *January 19th 2024*
    * Author talks about the stress of AI research in recent history - and everything he writes down is spot on accurate. 
    * I can particularly relate to the "No Role For Scientist" section - it's so hard today for academic research to have any sort of impact in this field. Engineering at max level of data and compute is what wins. The Bitter Lesson all over again...
    * The author unfortunately committed suicide... 

* [Learning The Elite Class](https://substack.com/home/post/p-63906299) *January 23rd 2024*
    * I always find Aella's writing quite interesting and insightful, and this little vignette is no exception. 
    * I am part of this "Elite Class", who learned the language very early on in life - as well as my being Moroccan which made me even more fluent in this "polite plastic bubble around each person that nobody's really trying to pierce through".
    * Although through my years in Science & Research (where this Elite is rather rare), I have become accustomed to being around people who do not speak this language, but I must admit I rarely reflect over how it must feel for them - especially when they end up being part of such events.
    * That reminds me of a funny day where a South American man who had a crazy immigration story ended up at a PhD defense at INI - invited by Linus if I recall correctly. The guy was obviously from a different world, but had his shit together. He was a "axe throwing instructor". Yep, an axe throwing instructor. Pretty wild. I wonder what it was like for him to be surrounded by academics whose live revolved around Science and Knowledge. Sure, this is not the same as the elite class stuff, but the mismatch was just about the same.

* [David Perell on the AI boom and existential crisis](https://x.com/david_perell/status/1894143267878703562) "Want proof? Scroll back to the beginning of this piece. You'll notice that I pulled you in by talking about a battle I’m fighting. If you’ve read this far, it’s because you’re interested in my personal crisis. I haven't thrown any data at you. All I've shared is personal experience. The point is that human interest stories aren't going away. It’s like how computers are already better at playing chess than people, but nobody watches live streams of computers playing chess and Magnus Carlsen is still a huge name. Writing will be the same."

* [Aspire to be a great contigency planner - Lloyd Blankfein](https://x.com/Globalflows/status/1642303459251863553) "I'm in the risk management business, so I don't take it for granted that I can see 4 inches into the future... What we actually aspire to be is less to see the future, but more be great contigency planners. When you contigency plan really well, you can respond very fast to what's happening, because you thought through all the possibility. You're reacting so quickly and well that it seems like you had anticipated completely."
