        <h1>Interesting Reads of 2024</h1>
        <p>I often read cool articles, or watch great youtube videos. But they might not be great enough for me to add on my "Internet Favorites" section. So here they are, as well as some personal notes on them. 
        <br /><br />
        Who knows - maybe your mind is currently open for some fascination? Maybe you'll find something here...</p>

 * [Lessons from Peter Thiel](https://www.8vc.com/resources/lessons-from-peter-thiel). 
    * Don't divide attention
    * When hiring, value "skill acquisition potential", as opposed to pre-existing skill
    * "Being the winner means being in the 99.99-percentile. A winner at the top takes nearly everything, and only a pittance goes to the others — so being 99.99-percentile is worth an order of magnitude or two more than being just 98-percentile. If it’s 1am and you’ve already got something that is very good, this is why it’s worth spending the next couple of hours to make it amazing."
    * 5. "Use small details as indicators to point to the larger truth — and be alert when they point to conclusions you don’t like." Judge the quality of a restaurant by the quality of its toilet paper. If it got the cheapest toilet paper, you can be sure it got the cheapest out of many other things.  
    
* [Reflections on Palantir](https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/reflections-on-palantir)
    * Excellent article on what makes Palantir a great company with a good work ethos.
    * I found the distinction between Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE) and and (PD) engineers super interesting. FDE do fast and dirty development, PD do the clean work but much slower. "The PD engineers then ‘productize’ what the FDEs build, and – more generally – build software that provides leverage for the FDEs to do their work better and faster.2"
    * "The critical case against Palantir seemed to be something like “you shouldn’t work on [morally gray] things, because sometimes this involves making morally bad decisions”. An example was immigration enforcement during 2016-2020, aspects of which many people were uncomfortable with. But it seems to me that ignoring [morally gray] entirely, and just disengaging with it, is also an abdication of responsibility. Institutions in [morally gray stuff] need to exist. The USA is defended by people with guns. The police have to enforce the law, and - in my experience - even people who are morally uncomfortable with some aspects of policing are quick to call the police if their own home has been robbed. Oil companies have to provide energy. Health insurers have to make difficult decisions all the time. Yes, there are unsavory aspects to all of these things. But do we just disengage from all of these institutions entirely, and let them sort themselves out?"
