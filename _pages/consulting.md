## Consulting 

When I am not doing scientific research, I often have the chance to work on different kinds of projects. Some of them include: 

* Leading a project as an independant consultant for a local Moroccan DIY company aiming to start a digital transition.
* Advising Ed-Tech companies on strategies for teaching tech-related topics (Programming, Data-science etc...).
* Design teaching material for Ed-Tech companies. 

I am typically someone who can get obsessed with things I'm working on for a while, and deliver a lot in not so much time. If you need help developping something, or if you need advising and accompaniement for projects that are relevant to my expertise, <a href="mailto:ytaoudi@student.ethz.ch">reach out</a>!
