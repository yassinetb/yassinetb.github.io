PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REPORT TYPOS AND INACCURACIES. **</p> <p>In June 2024, I had the chance to travel to Uzbekistan for 10 days, visit the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara, and most importantly, extensively interact with my friend Amir’s Uzbek family and attend the wedding of his cousin - <em>Dilshod Aka</em>. This trip was nothing short of extraordinary, and I try here to give an overview of why. I tried in this blogpost to synthetize the most interesting stories and observations about my stay in Uzbekistan - a country with rich historical relevance, strong culture and traditions, and most importantly, a country still very preserved from the cultural dilution caused by globalization and mass tourism.</p> <p>Before jumping in, I’d like to extend my sincerest gratitude to Amir for organizing this trip, opening us the door to his loving family and translating the many idiosyncrasies of the Uzbek society. I’d also like to thank Dilshod Aka for having us at his wedding, taking care of us throughout the entire trip and always entertaining us with jokes and good spirit - I wish him and his <em>Keline</em> all the best for the life they are starting together.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/trio_uzbek-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/trio_uzbek-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/trio_uzbek-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/trio_uzbek.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="prelude---an-ode-to-friendship-hospitality-and-internationalization">Prelude - an Ode to Friendship, Hospitality and Internationalization</h2> <p>The story of my presence in Uzbekistan can be traced back to 2007, when Amir (10 years old at the time) and his family unexpectedly won the green card lottery and left their traditional Uzbek life in Samarkand to move to the U.S.A. In another part of the world, Ayush (around the same age as Amir), born in India, relocates with his family to the U.S A due to his father’s work. Amir and Ayush attended the same high school in New Jersey. The great <strong>friendship</strong> that brought me to Uzbekistan started when Amir spotted the only foreign looking kid at school, and with the hope of showing off his Bollywood knowledge, approached Ayush with a shy “Hey, what’s up?”.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2023, where Ayush and I, both living in Zurich and studying at ETH, end up joining the same music band, and start hanging out - the beginning of another great <strong>friendship</strong>.</p> <p>Amir’s cousin, Dilshod Aka, has finally found <d-footnote> finding her was a long and tedious process </d-footnote> the one and set a date to get married in June, and Amir decided to pause his accountant life in New York City and attend the wedding. Eager to share the beauty of his country with his friends, he kindly asks whether a few extra seats can be left for his friends at the wedding. Dilshod Aka and his family, being the incredibly <strong>hospitable</strong> and loving people that they are, happily agree. Amir invites his closest friends, Jordan, Jake and Ayush. Funnily enough, Ayush (having already visited Uzbekistan with Amir) gives himself green card to invite his own Zurich Friends to the wedding - the more the merrier he says. And this is how I got invited to Dilshod Aka’s wedding, while having met Amir only once before, and never knowing the existence of the groom Dilshod Aka.</p> <p>In the end, we were a very <strong>international</strong> group of 8 foreigners (as the mexicans say, a group of 8 <em>gringos</em>) present at the wedding: two Americans, one Dutch, one German, one Moroccan (me), one Indian, one Chinese-American and one Swiss. And of course, we were with our Uzbek-American host Amir during the entire trip, who took us around and translated the many conversations we had with his family members and with different locals we met throughout our journey.</p> <p>Now that one has the context about my presence at this wedding, let’s dig into specific aspects of interest in the way of life for Uzbek people.</p> <h2 id="context-and-history">Context and history</h2> <p>Some of the stories and observations I will discuss are best understood with some historical context in mind. However, if you know the situation of the country, or if you don’t really care about history, feel free to ignore and move on to the next section.</p> <h3 id="between-persia-the-mongols-and-ussr">Between Persia, the Mongols and USSR</h3> <p>Uzbekistan, situated in Central Asia, has historically been at the crossroads of multiple significant and diverse cultural, political, and religious movements, mainly due to its position along the Silk Road. The Persians established a presence in the region, substantially establishing growth and prosperity through trade. This era saw the area become an important centre during the Islamic Golden Age, with prominent intellectuals hanging out in Bukhara or Samarkand, such as Ibn Sina or Omar El Khayyam.</p> <p>The Persian influence was ended by the Mongol invasion led by Genghis Khan. A few generations later, Timur, descendant of the Mongol elite, established Samarkand as the capital of the vast Timurid Empire. Other great leaders, from the same lineage, came after Timur, notably the astronomer Ulugh Bek, who carried on the heritage of Samarkand as a renowned center of scientific study.</p> <p>Later, Babur, a descendant of both Timur and Genghis Khan, shifted his focus eastward, conquering parts of India and founding the Mughal Empire. While Uzbekistan was not directly part of the Mughal Empire, it remained culturally connected to this powerful dynasty.</p> <p>From the 19th century onward, Uzbekistan, along with much of Central Asia, was gradually incorporated into the Russian Empire. Tashkent, the current capital, became the political center of Russian Turkestan. This Russian influence continued until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, after which Uzbekistan declared its independence.</p> <p>This simplified historical context exemplifies the wide range of cultural influences that have shaped Uzbekistan throughout its history. Persian culture dominated for several centuries. The Mongol invasion led to a golden age of knowledge and science. Islam was a constant presence, both through Persian influence and during Timurid empire reign. The Mughal Empire, founded by Babur (who was born in present-day Uzbekistan), extended its influence to India. Finally, Russian and Soviet rule left their mark on the country. All of these diverse influences remain perceptible within modern day Uzbekistan.</p> <h3 id="languages">Languages</h3> <p>The influence of all these cultures is directly sensed through the diversity of languages that are spoken in Uzbekistan, and the different influences these languages have.</p> <p>The current official state language is <em>Uzbek</em>, which is a Turkic language, and written primarily in Latin alphabet since 1993. Indeed, after the fall of the Soviet union, Uzbekistan wanted to get rid of as much Russian influence as possible - so they enforced Latin alphabet as opposed to Cyrillic to write Uzbek - which had been in place since the 1920s. Educational establishments today only teach the Latin notation, even though the Cyrillic notation is all over the place, especially amongst older generations. Fun story: a Tunisian/Turkish friend whom we met in Bukhara spoke an entire conversation in a restaurant with an Uzbek lady - my friend spoke Turkish while the waiter answered in Uzbek, and they understood each other.</p> <p><em>Tajik</em> is another widely spoken language in Uzbekistan, particularly in the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand (where we were) because of the population of ethnic Tajiks, dominant in these cities. The Tajik language is a variety of Persian, which I guess makes the vast number of similar words I spotted between Tajik and Arabic less surprising. Still - I did find a wide range of similar words, which I was fascinated by - more on this later. While Persian is written in Persian characters (very similar to Arabic alphabet), Tajik is almost exclusively written in Cyrillic. It is not taught in schools - and is left as a spoken language between Tajik people of the region.</p> <p><em>Russian</em> is a bit like the English of the region - the common denominator for all surrounding countries. This is the language people do business with, both within Uzbekistan and across the region. The current relations between Uzbekistan and the Russian language are obviously difficult - seen by some as a language they don’t want to have anything to do with anymore, and by others as a prominent language of Uzbek history, widely spoken and useful in the region. It is today not recognized as an official language, but some people are pushing for it to be recognized as such. I imagine mostly in the western parts of Uzbekistan where the Russian influence is still significantly more pronounced.</p> <h3 id="end-of-dictatorship-opening-up-to-the-world-and-tourism">End of dictatorship, opening up to the world and tourism</h3> <p>In 2016, Uzbekistan’s first (authoritarian) president Islam Karimov passed - and that was the beginning of a (positive?) set of changes in the country. The new president Mirziyoyev started a gradual liberalization process, opening up the political system (although it still is far from being a democracy per se). Regional relations were drastically improved, particularly Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Media have significantly more freedom, and a subsequent freedom of what people consume over the internet - you can imagine the influence of the internet in this country. Foreign investments became more attractive, with privatization efforts from originally state-owned companies. Bref, a large set of measures of the sort that basically started putting Uzbekistan on the international map, as a safe, flourishing, open, and good country to deal with. That’s what brought me there - despite us being 300 km away from the Afghan border where things are much less joyful.</p> <p>What I’d like you to remember from this is that Uzbekistan has essentially opened up less than 10 years ago. This process of opening up takes a lot of time, but is typically accelerated with the increase of tourism and now available access to internet. We are still in the early days of Open-Uzbekistan; early days where incredibly few people speak English, and people still live very strong and <em>non-diluted</em> cultural norms. If you are lucky enough to travel to Uzbekistan and interact with the local people, you’ll be interacting with people that might have almost never seen non Uzbek people in their lives, let aside spoken to them. And that’s an incredible way to experience a new culture - raw, pure and untouched - and that’s what it felt like for us, and what made it so fascinating to me.</p> <h2 id="disjoint-observations">Disjoint observations</h2> <h3 id="lost-and-found-in-translation">Lost (and found) in translation</h3> <p>The entire trip was a game of translation - cultural and linguistic - where Amir had to translate both the conversations we were having with locals and his family, as well as the background behind some of the things we’d observe and ask him about. Thankfully, not everything had to be translated - particularly to Ayush (Indian) and myself (Moroccan). Ayush, fluent in Hindi, and I, fluent in Arabic could understand multiple words of Tajik; even more importantly, we could understand and relate to many cultural norms that we observed within their society. Regarding the similarities between Tajik and Arabic, this is not very surprising given that Tajik is essentially a Persian dialect, and Persian and Arabic do share a lot of words, but I had not realized this before arriving there - so I took note and was amazed by the similarities between my language and a language I had never heard about before. Here is a list of these words, most often pronounced slightly differently, and funnily enough, written in Cyrillic…</p> <ul> <li>Amir: Means prince in both Arabic and Tajik. Interestingly, it also means rich in Hindi and Urdu.</li> <li>Maalem: Professor in both Tajik and Arabic. the root of the word can also be found in different contexts, similar to arabic “3ilm”</li> <li>Ostad: Professor in Arabic and Tajik</li> <li>Kitab: Book in Arabic, Tajik, Hindi and Urdu</li> <li>Rahmat: Thank you in Tajik, which relates to “ra7mat” in Arabic, signifying thankfulness and blessing.</li> <li>Mosibat: disaster in Tajik and Arabic</li> <li>Fil: Elephant in Tajik and Arabic</li> <li>Fa9at: only in Tajik and Arabi</li> <li>Saman: translates to “sky”, and very close to “Samaa” which is the arabic word for it. Interestingly, it means “atmosphere” or “surrounding” in Urdu.</li> <li>Istiqlol: independance</li> <li>Oua9t: time in Hindi, Arabic and Tajik</li> <li>Nakhs: sleep in Tajik and Arabic</li> <li>Characha: road in Tajik, which reminded me of chari3 in Arabic - also meaning road.</li> <li>Choukour: greatfulness in Tajik, which is the same as “Shoukr” in Arabic</li> <li>Nassib: destiny in Tajik and Hindi, and arabic</li> <li>Khizmat: duty to work to your brothers in Tajik (not simply “work”). Work in Arabic is “Kidma”.</li> <li>Lakin: “But” in arabic and Tajik.</li> </ul> <h3 id="relation-to-islam">Relation to Islam</h3> <p>This was perhaps the biggest surprise for me - as I come from a Muslim country and was raised Muslim myself.</p> <p>Uzbek people are very religious, speak about it all the time, and have it tightly embedded in their traditions - and so despite it officially being a secular state. Prayers were told during wedding, and every single (male) person whom I told I was Moroccan to hugged me when they realized I too was Muslim. This is also visible in the architecture, as mosques are order of magnitudes better built, designed and cared for than virtually every other construction in the country.</p> <p>Yet their relation to Islam feels very different than the one we have in Arab countries. First and foremost, I find incredibly curious that no one spoke a word of Arabic, yet they can recite a few verses of the Quran (sometimes, but not often, a lot). This is something I have trouble comprehending - believing in a book which language they use everyday without understanding. While they are not the only country in this case (e.g. Indonesia), it was my first time being exposed to this - and I found it rather intriguing.</p> <p>Another interesting point is how common it is to drink alcohol for Uzbek people - certainly, this must have remained from the Soviet influence, but it seems to be totally normalized and not hidden - which is completely different from Arab countries where Alcohol is taboo and hidden (not consumed in public).</p> <p>One must note however that Islam, although historically present since the early days of Islam, has seen a very important rise in the recent years, with many Uzbek people becoming increasingly radical and serious in their practice, especially in younger generations - which many Uzbek people do not see from a good eye. Perhaps the best testimony of this is a story we heard from Amir’s aunt, <em>Khola</em> who is a primary school teacher in Samarkand. She shared with us that the school refused to accept little girls wearing the headscarf, and that they’d always demand the girls take them off. Often, the girls would not accept to take their headscarf away, and the school would put the names of the girls on a “to watch list” <d-footnote>the exact phrasing for this got lost in translation</d-footnote>. This would be impossible to do in Morocco for example, where little girls wearing headscarf is totally normal and accepted. <em>Khola</em> certainly agreed with the measure from the school, and expressed clear reluctance to this new wave of “Islamization”, even criticizing some of her own family members who, as she says, become overly religious in the last few years. She said: “Uzbekistan doesn’t have a tradition of extreme Islam - it is not us - we are open minded and moderate in our practice.”.</p> <h3 id="men-and-women-dynamics">Men and Women dynamics</h3> <p>This also was fascinating to me, because it felt so different from what I am used to experience.</p> <p>I’ll always recall the great surprise I felt on our first evening in the new and modern (and gentrified) neighbourhood of “Silk Road Samarkand”, and seeing local woman dressed in a very liberal way - with colourful dresses, long hair down, taking pictures of themselves, and a complete feeling of safety and confidence in their attitude. This is not the norm in most Arab countries - at least not so freely in public places.</p> <p>In contrast, in this exact same place of great freedom for women, I observed that practically no table had men and women seating together in it. Single families (husband + wife + kids) would seat together, but as soon as more than one couple was dining, men and women had separate tables, and did not talk to one another. The kids, of course, would always be seated with the women, while men did men thing and their table.</p> <p>This was also very clear at the wedding, where amongst 20 tables, our table of foreigners was the only one where men and women were seating together - everything else was either men only or female only. Naturally, when it came to dancing, men and women would never dance together - two distinct groups formed and danced independently with one another. In fact, the only woman I made eye contact with at the wedding was the professional dancer they had hired who was the only person dancing with both men and women. Yes, I didn’t make eye contact with the bride either - but more on that later.</p> <p>In general, the social norms behind male/female dynamics are extremely strict in Uzbekistan. There is no culture of dating - only a culture of finding a wife/husband. The alternative for men is looking for women “to have fun with” - whom men openly say that they would never marry. Uzbek women are protected within their family before they find a husband, often not allowed to travel and engage in some activities to protect their reputation and keep them suited for a good marriage. Women get married young, and once they do, engage very little with other men in social settings - especially outside of their direct family.</p> <p>One thing that I also found fascinating was that it was perceived as extremely rude to ask questions about the wife of people we’d interact with, or see pictures of them. You would never see an Uzbek person with a picture of their wife as a background picture on their phone for instance. Of course (lol), you’re allowed to ask for a picture of the girl if the relationship is not serious, but as soon as marriage is on the table and the intentions are serious, don’t you dare asking for a picture of the wife, complimenting how she looks, or anything remotely similar to this.</p> <p>It overall was fascinating to me that women dress so freely, often do not wear headscarf, yet are perceived and treated in such a strict and conservative way - more so than most Arab countries I know of. And men take these traditions incredibly seriously when it comes to their wife!</p> <h3 id="social-classes-and-attitude-towards-money">Social classes, and attitude towards money</h3> <p>It’s usually rather straightforward for me to see through social dynamics and “classes” - I did not manage to in Uzbekistan.</p> <p>It felt like there wasn’t any strong social fracture between working, middle and high-earning classes - as if all of them peacefully lived together, in a not so different way. Being African (and having several Indian, European, North and South American friends), I know very well that countries often have notable high-earning classes that are clearly distinguished in their way of life from the rest of the population. I did not see anything resembling this in the two cities we have visited in Uzbekistan. Maybe I just didn’t see them? Maybe they are hidden? Well, probably not - we actually were staying in one of the rich neighbourhoods of Samarkand, and it certainly didn’t feel as strongly disparate compared to other countries I know. Of course, some people have more money than others, but it never felt like it really mattered.</p> <p>I discussed this with Amir, and he agreed that it also felt to him like people lived rather homogeneously together, and that people who had more money were not at all living in lavish and ostentatious ways. He suggested that there might be more of this going on in the capital Tashkent - but that ostentation and strong social fracture from wealth was not a significant thing in Uzbekistan.</p> <p>I also asked Amir a more specific question about marriage to try to get a queue of what was going on in terms of social expectations and ways people had of “climbing the social ladder”. Amir told us that socio economic status was not a major determining factor for marriage - women do not particularly seek wealth when choosing life partners. The ability of a man to provide decent life conditions is enough for him to be considered a suitable partner.</p> <p>Now I am not sure why I observed this, nor whether it is accurate. It might be very different in Tashkent, the capital, which is closer culturally to Russia, and where all big companies and government officials reside. But hearing from Amir that wealth did not matter so much for marriage was definitely not something I expected to hear. And what comforts me in my position about “class homogeneity” is that I never felt like people were hungry for money.</p> <p><strong>Attitude towards money</strong></p> <p>Tips are not really a thing in Uzbekistan. In fact, many people will almost get offended if you try to leave a tip. We had to ask one of our waiters who had given us stellar service whether he’d be okay to accept a tip (which was only worth ~10% of the bill). Although he accepted, he was initially reluctant and slightly embarrassed about it. Strange in a country where the living wage is so low?</p> <p>The many touristy shops we went to - the kind of shops and sellers that usually take great pleasure in ripping off tourists - always gave us reasonable prices. Of course, they were to be negotiated, but we never managed to get them under 20% under the initial asking price. In Morocco, I know that they would, without shame, ask you for 3 times what the product is actually worth, and you’d negotiate for a long time with them, and that’d be completely normal. Uzbek shop-owners did not appreciate us negotiating for too long, and again, never accepted to go below ~20% of the original asking price (and we tried! Remember I am Moroccan and can negotiate…).</p> <p>Perhaps the most shocking of all to me were taxi drivers. We’d always take uber-like taxis (to avoid getting scammed) where the price was calculated on the app, and we’d have to pay in cash at the end of the ride. Often, we’d have rides that would cost us something like 21500 UZS (~2 USD). If we gave 20.000 + 10.000 in bills, since they often did not have the change, they would always rather give us back the 10.000 and be paid less than they should rather than give us back 5000 and get paid more than they should. This was unheard of to me, taxi drivers preferring to be paid slightly less than slightly more!</p> <p>Both the “classes” dynamics and attitude towards money feel somewhat concordant. It feels like people live pious and decent lives, where what matters most is to be there for one’s family and children. Money is important of course, but it’s not the most important thing in life - values, respect and integrity are significantly above money.</p> <p>Globalization and liberalization have a very bad history with “values, respect and integrity”. Will Uzbekistan get corrupted through external influences, increase of tourism and globalization? Maybe they will, but I hope they won’t - because this was certainly one thing that makes Uzbek people extraordinary - not the only one though.</p> <h3 id="hospitality">Hospitality</h3> <p>Indeed, respect, moderation and integrity are not the only goods traits of Uzbek people. They are also incredibly hospitable - and guests are above everything else.</p> <p>You should just read again the context of my visit in Uzbekistan: me and 7 other people were invited to a wedding of someone we had never heard of before in our lives! Dilshod Aka, and the entirety of Amir’s family were so kind with us during our entire stay and took us around Samarkand at multiple instances despite being busy with the wedding preparation. I even remember Dilshod Aka who <em>invited all of us</em> to lunch the day after his wedding. I don’t even know what to say.</p> <h3 id="sex-and-taboo">Sex and taboo</h3> <p>Perhaps this is best exemplified by one Amir’s favourite thing to say about his family: “I always say that my parents had sex four times in their lives, one for me, two for my two younger brothers, and one for the one who never was born because of my mother’s miscarriage”.</p> <p>Sex here is a non-topic. Ayush actually told us loads of stories from his last visit to Uzbekistan, and many conversations with Amir’s cousins where they covered some sex stuff. They couldn’t believe that men would ever want to “go down” on women. This was something that was incredibly gross to them and profoundly not virile.</p> <p>We went to several pharmacies, I did not see a single box of condoms. And yes, we saw kids everywhere. I guess you can do the maths here.</p> <h3 id="children">Children</h3> <p>Children are most certainly sacred in Uzbekistan. They are brought everywhere with their family when the family goes out, and obviously are the central goal of Uzbek life. We have been asked on multiple instances whether we had children (and not necessarily whether we were married) - with everyone wishing us as many children as possible, as quickly as possible - as if it was the most obvious of things that we would want to have children.</p> <p>On that regard, I was indeed struck by the large number of kids I saw and interacted with. These interactions were always amazing and striking to me in many ways. I cannot remember seeing a single kid crying during the entire trip - and all of them were (if not asleep) always smiling and playing. Most importantly, I did not see a single kind doom scrolling TikTok or Youtube or some silly Ipad Video game. I am not sure if it’s because Uzbek people cannot afford tablets for their kids or if it’s not in the culture to give electronics to your kids, but whatever it is, kids were playing with one another and always were respectful of adults. I’ll probably forever remember an interaction with a 3-4 year old little girl in the train, who was playing with a little balloon (and whatever she could find on her way) by going back and forth through the wagon. I’d play some form of hide and seek with her (where I’d somehow hide in my seat), and she laughed during the entire 10-15 minutes we played together. She was loud when laughing, but not a single passenger in the train complained - everyone was fine with it and smiled through the interaction. The mother was around, and made sure that the kid was not doing anything silly and not being too bothersome for the passengers, but she mostly let her be - and indeed she was,</p> <p>I am not sure how they educate their kids there, but I have never seen such a high number of kids and so well educated and well behaved than in Uzbekistan - and let me state this again - not a single kid on their iPad or their parents phone - even at the wedding ceremony!!!</p> <h3 id="food">Food</h3> <p>The food was simple, but incredibly tasty and tasteful. The main advantage that Uzbekistan has is the quality of its ingredients, the greatness of its herbs - mainly dill, which they put virtually everywhere, and of course, the low price of food production. They also eat a lot of meat - like at every dish. None of us was vegetarian thankfully, so we all enjoyed it :). The bread was also quite good and fresh. You’d see it sold in the market amongst fresh products rather than in bakeries, which was not something I had seen before.</p> <p>I’ll mainly remember how tasty the tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, beetroots, chickpeas and fruits were. Yes, fruits… Peaches, nectarines, watermelons, melons… All incredibly sweet and delicious! I really did not expect the amount of desert land that Uzbekistan has!</p> <h2 id="wedding-day-and-the-bride">Wedding day, and the bride</h2> <p>I’ll try here to give an overview of how the wedding unfolded, and some interesting details about traditions and norms.</p> <p>CONTEXT: Groom stays in his family house, and bride moves in with him.</p> <h3 id="pre-wedding-day-mens-event">Pre-Wedding Day: Men’s event</h3> <p>The first event we were invited to was a men only event, at <em>8 in the morning</em>. It’s a breakfast, which starts with a series of prayers before people start eating. No loud music, no particular animation nor dancing - just the men on the groom’s side having breakfast and chatting men stuff.</p> <p>I must say I was shocked by the amount of food that was served, on each of the ~8 tables that were ready for guests. I also was shocked by the quantity of meat that was served, at <em>8 in the morning</em>. Another thing I was surprised by is the fact that two entire tables were completely empty - I assume they had prepared a seat for every single person they had invited, not accounting for no-shows. I feel like that it’s not customary to account for no shows at these celebrations - it seems fine to have way more food than needed, which probably showcases good hosting and wealth I imagine? This is is just my hypothesis.</p> <p>The breakfast ceremony was “closed” after one of the older and religious man present at the event gave a little speech with a little prayer. After he put the mic down, every single person stood up and left the room in the span 3 minutes. Waiters started cleaning up immediately after, turning lights down and packing chairs away. I was so surprised by this because we were still seating and eating a bit, and just very confused by how abruptly everyone had left.</p> <h3 id="wedding-day-part-1---1100-picking-up-the-groom">Wedding Day Part 1 - 11:00: Picking up the groom</h3> <p>Wedding day started on Tuesday <d-footnote>Yes, Tuesday. I think Dilshod Aka saved a bit of money by having the wedding on a Tuesday instead of usual Saturdays </d-footnote> with all of the groom’s family arriving at the groom’s house around midday. Men and women separation started at that point - our female friends Aline and Zenne from that point joined the monther and cousin of Amir, while we stayed with the men. We found Dilshod Aka in his bedroom, seating on his bed in a great suit and holding flowers in the middle of a photoshoot. This is one such traditions that really felt odd to me, but</p> <h3 id="wedding-day-part-2---1300-lunch-with-the-brides-family-but-without-the-bride">Wedding Day Part 2 - 13:00: Lunch with the bride’s family, but without the bride</h3> <h3 id="wedding-day-part-3---1500-picking-up-the-bride">Wedding Day Part 3 - 15:00: Picking up the bride</h3> <h3 id="wedding-day-part-4---1700-games">Wedding Day Part 4 - 17:00: Games?</h3> <h3 id="wedding-day-part-5---2000-dinner-party">Wedding Day Part 5 - 20:00: Dinner party</h3> <h3 id="wedding-day-part-6---0000-walking-back-the-groom-to-his-family-house">Wedding Day Part 6 - 00:00: Walking back the groom to his family house</h3> <h3 id="spotlight-the-speech">Spotlight: The speech</h3> <p>Yeah, we had to give a speech….</p> <p>From the beginning of the day, and particularly at the dinner party, people were very curious of our presence in the wedding - we all were very visibly not from there, and that intrigued people - in a good way. I assume this is one of the reasons why we were invited to the wedding: it’s rather special and unusual to have foreigners coming to a wedding in Samarkand, and I imagine seen as a very positive and thing - to the credit of the families who are bringing the foreigners who’d be seen as more international and modern.</p> <h3 id="spotlight-dancing">Spotlight: Dancing</h3> <h3 id="spotlight-food">Spotlight: Food</h3> <h3 id="spotlight-well-not-really-the-bride">Spotlight (well, not really): The Bride</h3> <h2 id="random-stories-and-fun-facts">Random stories and fun facts</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Alcohol</strong>: Uzbek people have a specific sign between each other to signify alcohol - they typically do it to ask if the person they are speaking to is interested in a drink. They basically flick their fingers onto the side of their neck twice, always with a cocky smile on their face - and that’s Uzbek (universal for them, as they did it to us assuming we’d know this too) sign for alcohol.</li> <li> <strong>Vogues</strong>: Uzbek people smoke “vogue” cigarettes - these are the super thin ones that are widely seen as “women” cigarettes in all countries I’ve ever been to. I was so confused by this.</li> <li> <strong>Toilet Paper</strong>: The toilet paper there has longer single-paper than usual - about 1.5 times the size of the single paper from rolls we are used to see.</li> <li> <strong>Aryans</strong>: Uzbek people love speaking about being Aryans, and the fact that no one would have bothered them during the second world war if Nazi Germany had reached their land.</li> <li> <strong>How to have children</strong>: Perhaps the most curious interaction I had… While at Registan seating next to my (female) friend Zenne, a 50ish year old man seating just next to us asked us where we were from, and immediately after we had answered, asked us if we had children. He had just assumed we were married since we were seating close together and talking in a very comfortable way - the kind of way that only wed couples would speak like here in Uzbekistan. He told us that he was one of the only ones in his surroundings whom had married his wife out of love instead of simply arranged marriage, and he was really proud to tell us that all his 3 children also married out of love. Amir was doing most of the translation at this point because he got a bit in depth into his stories and of course did not speak a word of English. At some point, he asked me apart from the rest of the group (with Amir for translation) and told me about a specific prayer that I should do before doing the bedroom deed in order to be able to have children, and assured me that he was certain we would manage to have children if we do so. This probably was one of the most special interaction of my life. I am neither married nor dating Zenne, nor am I typically keen on biology lessons from strangers in a language I don’t understand, but his kindness, authenticity, and genuine good wishes and intentions were just extraordinary. I most likely will never cross path again with this man, but I pray for the his wellness and prosperity, as well as that of his entire family</li> <li> <strong>Hamid El Shaeri and Snoop Dog</strong>: While virtually no one could speak English nor had left the country, they certainly knew their way around music. Snoop Dog was blasting in one of Amir’s cousin’s car - a rather religious cousin of course - I hope he didn’t know what the lyrics were about… I curiously heard at several instances Hamid El Shaeri, and several other popular arab songs. I hadn’t expected that.</li> <li> <strong>Kidneys</strong>: In Uzbekistan, India is for some reason known for Kindey transplants, which created an urban legend that “Indian people have 4 kidneys”. Ayush, wanting to be nice, invited one of Amir’s cousin to visit India, to which he responded… “I don’t need to go to India because I have the 2 kidneys I need - why would I go there if not for kidneys?”</li> <li> <strong>Surnames</strong>: The first grandson of the family gets to create his own “lineage”, which one does by taking the first name of your grandfather as last name. Amir is the first grandson of his family, so he indeed has a different surname than his own father and brothers. His surname is <em>Hirojedenov</em>, because his grandfather’s first name was Hirojeden. His brothers have the same last name as his father - <em>Djuarev</em>.</li> <li> <strong>Surat Yassine</strong>: In Registan, I visited the Madrasa of Ulug Beg (famous astronomer and leader in Samarkand, grandson of Timur) and found a massive copy of the Quran, written in stunning caligraphy. It was open on Surat’ Yassine. I got emotional…</li> <li> <strong>Happiness</strong>: Adding “jon” at the end of names means happiness. Amir’s full name is Amirjon. I liked to call myself Yassinejon during the trip…</li> <li> <strong>Older brother</strong>: “Aka” means older brother in Uzbekistan, and they use it at all times - for respect. Amir calls all of his older cousin by their first name and “aka” at the end. This is why I wrote “Dilshod Aka” (the groom), and not “Dilshod” which is his real name. One can also comnunicate with strangers like this - calling them “Aka”. Since you asked, they say “ouka” for “litte brother”.</li> <li> <strong>Kunte</strong>: The number one insult between boys is “Kunte” - meaning “faggot”. Obviously, Uzbekistan is deeply homophobic. Although Amir already brought two lesbian friends which he says was fine - though he said it would have been very different if it were two gay men.</li> </ul> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Yassine Taoudi-Benchekroun.
