        <h1>Internet Favourites</h1>
        <p>Sometimes I stumble upon some stuff on the internet that deeply impacts and fascinates me. I always feel an urge to share with my friends; but every mind is different - ideas that fascinate me often do not resonate with my friends in the same way, or at least, not at the same time. In the end, our fascination for an idea is less dependant on the idea's quality than it is dependant on our (unconscious) openness to it at a given time. 
        Who knows - maybe your mind is currently open for some fascination? Maybe you'll find something here...</p>

* [Something Left Unsaid - Lyle Mays Interview](https://www.lylemays.com/something-left-unsaid). This one really shook me for some reason, so much wisdom in it about his vision of the music industry and the process of creativity - of course, it can extend to so many different fields. I really went through a hardcore Lyle Mays phase - this was after I saw Pat Metheny's concerts in Montreux - I of course was completely mindblown, started digging and found out the extent of Myle's Genius.   

* [Universal Mind of Bill Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwXAqIaUahI&t=386s) This shook my world when I first saw this in my teens. It still leaves me inspired everytime I hear it.

* [You and Your Research - Richard Hamming](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html). Read this from a recommendation by Jimmy before the start of my PhD. Inspiring read that one should go back to very frequently while conductin research. 

* [The Bitter Lessons - Richard Sutton](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) Gotta love the plain HTML of this article - somewhat funny given the topic. Every scientist should read this - especially anyone interested in computing. This is what made me understand that Neuromorphic Engineering, as fascinating and beautiful as it was, wasn't gonna make the cut.  

* [Lennie Tristano - Tangerine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGLpczTtnEM) Look at that left hand... Oh and he's blind, of course. 

* [Demis Hassabis Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X7Koxx4qJE&list=FLVEGJyKdX1f_76VaLu_Viig&index=42) Demis is cool. Demis is very cool. This interview is a great one. 

* [The Language of The New Music - Wittgenstein & Schoenberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRI_ZSh6iF4&list=FLVEGJyKdX1f_76VaLu_Viig&index=71) This started my Wittgenstein obsession phase. I'm glad it ended though.
