* **The Latent Potential of Bamboo**

Bamboos, when first planted, don't see light of day for months. They just ignore the urge to grow high to instead, quietly, focus on building deep invisible roots. Building these roots requires a great deal of care, and, more importantly, patience. Indeed, patience—because, after months of quiet and unrecognized effort, spring eventually kicks in, and bamboos suddenly begin to grow. And when they do, they really do - all at once, at an astonishing rate, sometimes up to a meter per day.

Too often, our daily efforts are unrewarded - as we push forward, frustration and doubt deepen, and corrupt our will to continue the daily work. But we must have faith in the value of our quiet invisible work and internalize the concept of “latent potential”. Each unrecognized step strengthens our foundations and individuality, which only need the right spark to suddenly, burst out and shine into the world - all at once.

Continue building your potential, even when the results aren’t immediate, but don't forget to put yourself out into the world, seeking your own “spring.” The breakthrough often comes from a single, unexpected moment, which could never have led to anything without all the quiet work you did.
