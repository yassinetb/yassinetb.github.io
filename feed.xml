Below are a few disconnected thoughts based on my experience — I’m aware that these reflections won’t generalize to everyone. In fact, it might not even generalize to my future self — but I decided to put them in writing anyway — a <em>Memorabilia</em> for my future self.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="choosing-yourresearch">Choosing Your Research</h2> <p>During a PhD, figuring out what problem to work on is more challenging and critical than solving the problem.</p> <h3 id="good-research">Good research?</h3> <p>In the business world, the <em>loss function</em> is generally <d-footnote>There is an increasing number of businesses who claim to primarily optimize for quality of the product, as opposed to the profit they generate. While this may sometimes be true, the quality of product is almost always adjacent to revenues. Assuming that businesses loss function is to maximize money subsequently still holds in such cases. </d-footnote> obvious— maximize revenue. In the research world, the loss function is much more convoluted — “produce good research”? What is “good research” to begin with? </p> <p>There is no absolute way to evaluate what good research is. Is it research that gets cited a lot? Is it research that remains influential decades after its publication? Is it research that gets published in top journals? Is it research that manages to solve very difficult problems? Is it research that manages to solve problems that many people care about? While all of these can somewhat be considered metrics of research quality, they often are not adjacent. Highly cited and top journal papers are not necessarily works that significantly influence a field. Solving very difficult problems is not necessarily something that <em>a lot of people will care</em> about, nor is it necessarily something that <em>people will care a lot</em> about.</p> <p>Since we cannot find an absolute for what good research is, I feel it’s best to assess it relative to the person conducting it: <em>doing good research is doing the kind of research you look up to</em>. For some, it’s a technical and precise exploration of niche intricacies, for others, it’s information integration and rethinking the direction of a field, for others, it might be real-world-oriented technical breakthroughs.</p> <p>Our role as researchers is to produce research that aligns with what we look up to. And, <em>not</em> research just for the sake of publishing. This applies to every creative activity I guess - one should seek to produce the kind of work that they can be proud of and that they think other peers might look up to as well.</p> <p>Now this is hard. Not only do you have to be incredibly performant and perseverant to achieve this <d-footnote> particularly in today's hypercompetitive world </d-footnote>, but you also have to navigate the thorny landmine of academic pressure to publish. Playing this conflictual game is certainly the greatest challenge of modern academic research - and I can feel it already.</p> <p>A concrete example that applies to me is to decide on whether to pursue publishing in NeurIPS style conferences, where incremental performance on benchmarks is the general pursuit, vs work that gets traditionally published in journals - slower, more tedious, and more risky too. Both are good in their own way - but one should consciously position themselves. <d-footnote> I'm saying this but I'm not even sure that's the case. Consciously positioning oneself in advance is great for self-help textbooks - but the reality is often more nuanced, and life happens and takes you in unexpected directions.</d-footnote></p> <p>Successfully navigating this conflict takes a lot of discipline. One key aspect of this discipline is learning how to fight the right battles: the ones we’ll enjoy fighting and actually have a chance at winning.</p> <h3 id="navigating-scientific-distractions">Navigating scientific distractions</h3> <p>Academia can be an incredibly diverse and exciting universe, where ideas in all shapes and colors flow from everywhere.</p> <p>People come to you with their new ideas all the time, they ask your opinion about things. Sometimes you’ll read a paper and think “huh, this could be cool”, Some other time, your supervisor will come to you with their new idea and you know it would be a good thing if you tried it. Sometimes (my personal favourite) you have a conversation with a scientist from a different field in a bar and see some parallels between both of your research and think that this would make a sexy and unconventional collaboration.</p> <p>It is undeniably a privilege to evolve in environments where this is the norm, but it comes with a price: the burden of choice, and the challenge of focused attention.</p> <p>The more ideas are around you and the more people are around you, the more difficult it becomes to focus your attention and have a clear sense of direction — especially for the curious and playful spirits — which I’m lucky to be. But I remember the famous Steve Jobs quote from his Stanford commencement address: “you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward” — trying to build your own direction while doing research is I think rather overrated; the story will emerge by itself towards the end — provided you consistently do <em>due diligence</em>. The trick is in the last part: doing one’s due diligence.</p> <h3 id="due-diligence">Due Diligence</h3> <p>What’s due diligence for a PhD student?</p> <p>It’s a <em>continuous</em> dance between 4 core activities:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Create:</strong> This is the core of your research, and the reason you were hired. This is the work you do in the lab: conducting your experiments and writing about them. This is where the entirety of your knowledge comes to life to create something that people around you (and hopefully yourself) may care about. And yes, I call this “create” because it is supposed to be creative work, not just mere execution of pre-existing methodologies without any novelty. Research is a creative activity.</li> <li><strong>Read</strong>: Papers, textbooks, taking classes… This is the space where you discover ideas and internalize them.</li> <li><strong>Interact</strong>: Your discussion with your supervisors, your time at conferences, your time as a T.A., your meetings with the students you supervise, or casual science chit-chat with your friends and colleagues. This is where you get feedback on your ideas (and results), as well as share your ideas with people who care for them: sharing is learning. This is also where you find other people to work with.</li> <li><strong>Think</strong>: Integrate all of the other three elements, iterate and adjust accordingly. Ask yourself the difficult questions: is this project actually going anywhere? Is this person worth working with? Is this work routine working or should I adjust? This is where you decide on a macro-level what to change in your way of practicing the previous three activities.</li> </ol> <p>All of them are equally important and mutually beneficial. One can think of this like a control problem — where optimal state (successful research and timely graduation) can only be reached if these four are well balanced during the span of your PhD.</p> <p>The last part is probably the most often overlooked. A PhD can feel like a tight corridor that ones tries to escape - especially towards the middle of it (I’ve been told). It’s important to feel like one has the capacity to change their way of doing and their direction - the <em>Sunk-Cost Fallacy</em> can be brutal in Academia…</p> <p>During my first three months, I made a different mistake — I did very little 1) and only did 2) and 3) and 4). Bad too — obviously. But I blame the beginning for this mistake — the future will be different, especially since I now have a bit more momentum on different projects and can prototype quickly.</p> <h2 id="collaborations-and-supervision">Collaborations and Supervision</h2> <h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3> <p>Choose wisely.</p> <p>Don’t do too much. Don’t do too much. Did I say you shouldn’t do too much?</p> <h3 id="supervising-students">Supervising students</h3> <p>Supervising students, even if they are incredibly well chosen, is no substitute for doing science yourself. It is neither sufficient nor even satisfying to only give them a project and let them be. I already have three students under my wing and feel a bit overwhelmed by having to manage them — I simply do not have the time to have a detailed look at the details of their science.</p> <p>This directly results in the well-known shortcoming of most PIs in the world out there: losing touch with the daily bread of research. I am first hand realizing what this means — it’s a weird thing to just let go of the daily intricacies of experiments, and trust someone else to properly do the details themselves. You eventually lose control over things, and also lose some level of understanding about what is being done and how it is achieved. Of course, in my case, where my students use technologies and experiment ideas that I have played with quite a bit, the issue is less problematic than PIs not having done lab work/coding in years — but one still feels the dangers of it and the struggle of giving up control, and its consequence on one’s understanding of the parts.</p> <p>So why do people delegate? 1. Because they judge that their time is better spent doing different things, and 2. because they can achieve more in less time. Do I feel like my time is better spent thinking about research direction than doing research itself — I’m not sure. Do I feel like I can achieve more by having other students around me conducting research that I think should be done? I think so, but it hasn’t happened yet. This is where having good students come into play — when they get up to speed quickly and are actually capable of doing more and better than you could have done. This is rare. Most often, one typically spends weeks accompanying a student to set up an experiment that would take the supervisor a day to complete. However, I believe one must do the effort — if you get lucky once, the outcome surpasses the multiple failures.</p> <p>Now supervision has an additional layer compared to mere “delegation” — teaching. This is one part I value a lot. I feel a responsibility towards the students I supervise. I feel like I must, to the best of my abilities, show them the way, explain them things the best I could, and most importantly, inspire them to do good Science. This is a humbling experience, that takes human discipline, but also scientific rigor and knowledge. While I know that a lot of student project I’ll oversee won’t lead to ground-breaking research, I know I have the opportunity to positively influence one’s scientific career and attitude to work — and that is a privilege and responsibility I’m happy to carry.</p> <p>Oh, before I forget - Choose your students wisely. Don’t get too many. Don’t get too many. Did I say you shouldn’t get too many?</p> <h3 id="disjointed-supervision-thoughts-and-stories--i-couldnt-find-a-way-to-smoothly-connect-these-with-my-previous-paragraphs-so-i-just-put-them-here-without-transition-oops">Disjointed Supervision Thoughts and Stories <d-footnote> I couldn't find a way to smoothly connect these with my previous paragraphs, so I just put them here without transition. Oops</d-footnote></h3> <p>There are a number of interesting problems that one experiences while mentoring students. A couple of weeks ago, I realized that I had sent a student in the wrong direction (dead-end method). No big deal, “only” a few days of work were lost, but I should have done my homework better. In the moment I realized, I was torn between apologizing or slightly downplaying the time-loss into a “it’s fine, we learnt about X and Y in the process”. I picked a mix of both.</p> <p>It’s also a difficult to challenge to find the best way to motivate students. Should one be very demanding, or should one let them do their thing and only put as much as they are willing to put. After all, we do not pay students, and the cost of a badly performing students is “only” some time lost. I so far have chosen to let them be, and be as here as possible whenever they need me — let’s see if the results follow.</p> <h2 id="stimulation">Stimulation</h2> <p>To get through a PhD, you <em>need</em> to be in a stimulating lab, with stimulating people around you — that push you, towards whom you feel some kind of accountability. There is no way you get through this sane without it — no way.</p> <p>I feel it — some days I feel a push because of a good conversation, or because someone I look up to asks me a difficult question or expects some good work from me. I also have days where I don’t feel that at all — and these days, not only am I not motivated to get anything done, but my work also feels significantly less meaningful.</p> <h2 id="sleeping-in-on-a-random-tuesday">Sleeping in on a random Tuesday</h2> <p>Non-PhD/Academic friends often ask me (and other PhDs) how do PhDs navigate the freedom of working on what they want, and the freedom of not showing up to work on a random Tuesday. Truth is, it completely fucks us up. There is this impression that a single day of work doesn’t matter - and it’s completely true: a single day of work doesn’t matter in the greater scheme of your PhD <d-footnote>completing a PhD typically takes 3 to 6 years. So yeah, what's </d-footnote>. And since the only person you’re accountable to in a PhD is yourself <d-footnote>Yes, PhD students are also accountable to their supervisors, but it's often not perceived as such in practice. Students do PhD for themselves, not to please their boss and stay on the payroll.</d-footnote>, it makes it incredibly difficult to motivate oneself to do what should be done, to keep showing up every day, read the things no one asked you to read, do the projects no one asked you to work on, and explore the ideas no one is pushing you to explore.</p> <p>This makes the PhD experience very close to “creative” kind of careers, rather than “corporate” ones. Does it matter if you don’t compose that song? Does it matter if you don’t write that essay? Of course not - no one will know that you haven’t done it, and no one will care nor ask for it. But that song that you didn’t compose, that essay that you didn’t write, <em>that side-project that you never got to try out, that paper that you never took off your reading list</em> - it could have been the start of your best work. It could have been the start of a work that actually is the 10x kind of achievement that we are after in life.</p> <p>And why did you not do it? Because you didn’t show up on that random Tuesday - thus not putting time on anything else than strictly urgent work.</p> <p>Doing a PhD requires a special kind of discipline and organization. - to get you to show up every day, and master the exploration vs exploitation tradeoff. Every student who doesn’t manage to do so ends up depressed, and I think that even students who kind of manage to do so also end up depressed. Caring about your work makes life more difficult I guess <d-footnote>I should probably eventually write about why I care about my work and choose to do things the way I do them. Feel free to ask me if you are interested haha. Maybe I can also speculate on why others care about their work.</d-footnote>.</p> <p>One can also think of this as a <em>delayed gratification</em> problem. The work you do today has very minimal influence on the outcome of the end of the day. You’ll probably keep getting paid even if not a single gram of good work comes out of your mind for 6 months during your PhD <d-footnote>Many people I know went through such phases.</d-footnote>. But you need to firmly believe in the power of <em>compounded growth</em> to keep showing up.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years.”</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2> <p>There is no reasonable justification to pursue a PhD program, except to enjoy the daily bread of one’s research. You won’t make the world a better place by getting your PhD. You won’t save lives through your PhD research (if you think that’s the case, think again). Oh, and you won’t earn money by doing your PhD either. In the best-case scenario, you make your grandmother a bit more proud of you than she already was. So why are you here, if it’s not to enjoy the process?</p> <p>Am I enjoying the day-to-day so far? Yes. Is it a bit painful? Also yes, but in a good way, the kind of painful that makes you grow as a scientist and human being.</p> <h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2> <p>I truly feel blessed to be part of the Institute of Neuroinformatics, and that I chose to pursue this PhD instead of going to industry. I love science, and I love being surrounded by people who care about producing interesting work, and discuss ideas constantly. I love that ideas are discussed, rather than money or means to money.</p> <p>The road will, however, be bumpy. Looking ahead, I must do a better job at focusing my attention on the things that matter and getting things done - if not for the sake of my PhD, rather for the sake of my enjoyment of it. Well actually, aren’t both equivalent two sides to the same coin?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="open"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I officially started my PhD 3 months ago, and while my current results make me feel like I only started yesterday, I have already gone through quite a bit, and learned a few things about what it means to do Science and to conduct a PhD.

Disclaimer: I’m rather biased in my judgment — I am still at the Institute of Neuroinformatics (INI), but now as a PhD student.</p> <p>I won’t be getting into the details of the program in this blog post, as everything is already explained <a href="https://www.nsc.uzh.ch/en.html">here</a>. Rather, I’ll share some of my perspectives on things I liked and disliked in the program.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="nscs-home-institution---ini">NSC’s Home Institution - INI</h2> <p>The NSC program is run by the Institute of Neuroinformatics, which is located in the beautiful Irchel Park, home of the University of Zurich’s Science campus. The walk through Irchel Park that you’ll get to do every day to get to INI, through the changing seasons, is a privilege in itself — a “commute” unlike others.</p> <p>INI was established between the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich at the end of 1995. The mission of the Institute is to discover the key principles by which brains work and to implement these in artificial systems that interact intelligently with the real world: INI’s research focus, while varying greatly from one group leader to another, is still aligned with the initial mission.</p> <p>INI is a special place — a weird and unusual combination of warmth, kindness, chaos, and intellect. INI is unlike your typical scientific department office floor — it’s full of frames and pictures on the wall, celebrating scientists giants of the past, scientific ideas, and milestone moments of the institute. It is a very social institute, with several events organized, such as the colloquium talk followed by an apero every friday evening, the book club, or drinks for Masters and PhD students every Wednesday evening. Maybe you will be the driving force behind new social traditions at INI?</p> <h2 id="the-nsc-program">The NSC Program</h2> <p>The NSC program is a 90-credit program that students typically complete within 2 years, with some crazy students managing in as quickly as 1 year and other tranquille ones in 3 years. You must take the 45 credits worth of classes, and complete 45 credits worth of projects, and you’re good to go, and you do so at your own pace.</p> <p>The way you arrange your 45 credits worth of classes is largely free, although you do have some requirements such as the “Readings in Neuroinformatics” or “Basics of Instrumentation” classes. Students have access to realistically (as long as it’s somewhat related to the aims of the masters — and that’s not hard to justify) all of UZH and ETH science classes — that’s A LOT of options. In effect, no students have the same path in the program, and some students end up having their highest focus in fundamental mathematics or even chemistry. After all — all of these core sciences are fundamental to our understanding of the brain.</p> <p>Another great thing about NSC is that you are not in any way limited in the number of courses you take. The only (approximate) limitation is that you have three years to complete the program and graduate — leaving you ample time to do a lot of things.</p> <p>Through time, every student ends up diverging into a unique path of their own, sometimes very different from other students of the program, albeit always with a common denominator: the brain. This interdisciplinarity and multiplicity in perspectives are deeply embedded into INI’s history and mission: “discovering the key principles by which brains work and implement these in artificial systems that interact intelligently with the real world.”</p> <h2 id="nsc-projects">NSC Projects</h2> <p>Project work will be the most important part of your master’s (and cover the other 45 ECTS you should complete). You have a choice between doing 2 short projects and a short thesis, or directly a long thesis. In terms of duration, expect the following:</p> <ul> <li>Short project: 2–3 months long, usually working 2–3 days a week. 9 ECTS each</li> <li>Short thesis: 6 months long — deadline decided at the start of the project. Work as much as you can. 27 ECTS</li> <li>Long thesis: 9 months long — deadline decided at the start of the project. Work as much as you can. 45 ECTS</li> </ul> <p>There is a lot of diversity at INI when it comes to the projects you can pursue — just have a look at the different research happening in the various INI research groups to get a feel of this.</p> <p>INI makes it a bit annoying to do projects “externally” from INI. This makes sense as the program is obviously run to recruit researchers for INI, and that starts with short projects and thesis work. That being said, there are so many different outside collaborations from INI professors — they most often are happy to send you to a partner lab or company, and also allow you to go pursue things on your own.</p> <h2 id="tips-to-do-well-in-the-program">Tips to do well in the program</h2> <p>I recommend students devote their first year to taking courses, especially the harder ones. Your patience for studying for exams will go down as a function of time, and your eagerness to do research will grow. Explore and take as many classes as you can in the first two semesters, and dedicate the rest of your time to doing practically only project work.</p> <p>Doing two different semester projects can be a good idea if you are unsure what to dedicate your thesis to or who you’d best like to work with. You always have the option of extending a short project into a thesis if you are certain this is the right project for you.</p> <p>If you can, don’t rush into finishing, producing good science requires time, and openness to the world of ideas. Take the time to explore.</p> <h2 id="social-life">Social life</h2> <p>Another key component of doing well in this program is to take advantage of its community. NSC is a very small program, with about 5–10 students coming in every semester (out of ~250 applicants!) from all areas of the world. You should get to know everyone. You might not realize it, but that will help you become a better scientist. The NSC students are especially lucky since they have an entire room of the lab that is dedicated to them. The “Masters room” is an amazing place where you’ll get to work surrounded by other students of the program, and where you’ll make great friends. This is where all the fun and bonding happens, when suffering together through project work or exam revision. I have had some of the most amazing work days moments in that room, laughing hard and discussing fascinating things.</p> <p>Don’t limite your socializing to NSC students, PhD students, professors, staff are all extremely nice and welcoming, and most often physically present. People at INI are often insanely nice, and the vibe is super super cool. No one will go chase you and ask you to hang out, just be around INI, go to lunch with people, and do some effort to bring people together.</p> <h2 id="how-to-get-in">How to get in?</h2> <p>INI, although it’s unlike most masters programs I know of, is actually just like most masters programs I know of when it comes to applications. The committee seeks:</p> <ul> <li>Motivated students, who understand and truly value what they are applying for and show that this application is not only one amongst many.</li> <li>Talented students, with great track record of academic or industry experience and performance.</li> <li>Recommended students, who have worked with serious people who can testify of students’ ability to do work.</li> </ul> <p>Before you ask, I’ll answer some frequent questions:</p> <ul> <li>Some students with average grades got into the program, because they had great project work or an academic paper out. At the same time, some students got in while never having done serious science research project but just from outstanding academic record. Both grades and work/scientific experience matter, and are taken into account when applying — there is no fixed rule</li> <li>NSC purposely tries to recruit students from a wide variety of scientific backgrounds. The whole purpose of the program is to have variety of students to work around Neuroinformatics from a variety of different perspectives. I know NSC students who have majored in pharmacology, chemistry, biomedical engineering, and even a (pretty damn smart) one that graduated from a business school!</li> <li>INI is an academic institution that does academic research, so they obviously will naturally prefer academic references. HOWEVER — this does not mean that they would not appreciate and value the word of a previous non-academic employer that can testify of anything that is relevant to the work or culture at INI.</li> <li>Personal statements, just like everywhere else, should be about 1 page long and present 1) who you are 2) what your interests are 3) why you are a great candidate for <em>this program</em> and 4) what you would want to use your experience in this program for.</li> <li>If you feel like your application is not mature enough yet, I recommend taking time to work in research or in industry. Take a research project from your home institution, or email some professor (could be an INI professor/student!) to work on a project with them, and do good work. That will earn you a good reference and a nice extra paragraph on your personal statement.</li> <li>If you are serious about getting in, get to know the institute, read through the works of the professors/students who work at INI, understand the purpose and the values of INI. If you do this research and have conviction that you actually fit here, sending a good application will be effortless, and it’s likely to work. Oh and if it ever does not work, don’t hesitate to try again — that worked for me :)</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="open"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I frequently receive messages on LinkedIn or Twitter to share my experience of the Neural Systems Computation (NSC) master’s program, so I decided to write a little blog post to share it with everyone.

I guess I just thought I’d switch from one to the other whenever bored. Well, I never got bored, and ended up reading both at the same time; turns out they’re not so unrelated.</p> <p>Tolstoi and Attar delve deep into the topic of love and the whole rainbow of colors associated with the strangest and most powerful human emotion. They agree on one thing: love can be — and will be — devastating.</p> <h2 id="love-chez-tolstoy">Love chez Tolstoy</h2> <blockquote> <p>The truth is, that the whole affair [“falling in love”] has been exalted by poets and romancers to an undue importance, and that love in its various developments is not a fitting object to consume the best energies of men.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall, it’s not pretty in Tolstoy’s world. Two of the short novels I read are particularly noteworthy in understanding his stance on love and “romantic” relationships. Here is a very condensed outline of the account of love they make.</p> <p>Family Happiness: Masha, a young orphan (~18 years old), and a family friend, Sergei (~35 years old), come to fall in love in the purest of ways. They talk for hours about everything and nothing, dream about the future, and care so deeply for one another — nothing in the world matters to their eyes more than one another. They marry, and Masha starts to feel bored of their country life, Sergei is considerate enough to suggest moving to Petersburg for a while and living a social lifestyle. Masha navigates this new life with great success and becomes adored by the whole Russian bourgeoisie, but her husband slowly grows exacerbated by all of this social nonsense. Distance builds up, and they build resentment towards one another and eventually completely disconnect. Masha feels extremely depressed, angry, and lost — and a good part of the novel is dedicated to describing how she navigates (or rather, fails to navigate) this resentment and frustration. The novel however ends on a positive note — they manage to love one another again, albeit not as lovers anymore, but as the mother/father of their child, and live “happily” ever after. Kreutzer’s Sonata: A man, “Pozdnyshev”, within a (60-page long) uninterrupted monologue to a stranger on the train, tells the story of how he murdered his wife. He had always dreamt of a happy and peaceful family life. He eventually fell in love and married a “gentle soul”, but quickly realized that they were not a good match (and argues there is no such thing as a good match — lovers always end up growing away from one another, however good the original match — c.f. Family Happiness). They grow apart and develop resentment and jealousy toward one another, which consumes their energy, morals, and souls. Pozdnyshev’s wife eventually fills the void of her marriage with music — she plays piano and invites a (male) violinist friend of hers to play duets. Pozdnyshev is jealous and suspects adultery. One day, he comes back home from traveling and finds them playing music together in the living room, and in a burst of anger, kills his wife. In Pozdnyshev’s words, there can only be two outcomes of marriage: suicide or murder of one’s partner. The character in this story chose the latter. While both these stories have rather different flavors and outcomes, I believe they both are clear on something: the love of two individuals for one another, no matter the circumstances, will always lead to great pain and destruction. The intensity and strength of the emotion constrain lovers to forgo reason and morals.</p> <p>Tolstoy’s views on the topic, particularly influenced by the failure of his own marriage, turned increasingly grim and hopeless towards the end of his life — hence the much darker Kreutzer’s Sonata, where the beautiful and pure love only lasts for a mere few days (and is narrated within a few sentences only), as opposed to the years of happiness (and half the novel in writing) dedicated to narrating Masha and Sergei’s happy marriage.</p> <hr/> <p>To further comment on Tolstoy’s view on love, we should also discuss the afterword of Kreutzer’s Sonata, written a few years after the publication of the novel, where the author explicitly clarifies his views on marital life and the “fantasy of falling in love”. He argues that the only solution to a sane and elevated life is chastity and celibacy. Tolstoy is, especially at the end of his life, strongly influenced by his faith and biblical understanding in his warning and reservations with regard to marital life. Kreutzer’s sonata comes with not one, but two epigraphs from the Gospel of Matthew:</p> <blockquote> <p>“But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” Matthew 5:28 “The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.” Jesus replied, “Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given””. Matthew 19:10–11</p> </blockquote> <p>It seems that Tolstoy sees no difference between lust and love and that no matter what, besides it unavoidably leading to despair, is actually also sinful. A noteworthy justification of this argument is the fact that neither Jesus nor the apostles ever married — and they exemplify The Right Way in Christianity. Tolstoy however acknowledges that “not everyone can accept this word”, and that is the curse of mankind — only a handful few are capable of abstaining from love (or lust?) to manage living elevated lives.</p> <p>It is interesting to remind oneself that in the two other Abrahamic religions, marriage is the most natural of things for human beings, including for people of significant importance — for example, the Prophet Mohamed married multiple times, and two of his wives (Khadija and Aicha) have been of notoriously positive influence in his life — a life committed to God.</p> <h2 id="interlude---what-is-sufism">Interlude - What is Sufism?</h2> <p>This article (from which much of this section is paraphrased) makes a great account of the Sufi tradition and practice.</p> <p>Sufism can be described as Islamic mysticism or asceticism, which through belief and practice helps Muslims attain nearness to the Almighty by way of direct personal experience of God. Belief in pursuing a path that leads to closeness with God, ultimately through encountering the divine in the hereafter, is a fundamental component of Islamic belief. However, in the Sufi tradition, this proximity can be realized in this life.</p> <p>There is a rich body of Sufi literature, with its most prominent representant being the well known poet Rumi, whose many poems on the theme of Love are widly read and quoted in today’s world. His influence on the Sufi world is very significant — and we should note that Rumi’s repeatedly aknowledge as his main master and influence our very own Attar:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Attar traveled through all the seven cities of love, While I am only at the bend of the first alley.”</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="love-chez-attar-and-in-the-sufi-practice">Love chez Attar and in the Sufi practice</h2> <p>The Conference of the Birds is a Sufi poem telling the story of a group of birds who seek spiritual meaning and elevation. They seek advice from the wisest bird they know — the Hoopoe — who advises them to embark on a spiritual journey to meet their Almighty. The journey is long and arduous, and many birds give up along the way. Those who stay eventually discover that the Almighty was there all along the Way — within themselves.</p> <p>On their way to find God, the birds must go through the notorious 7 Valleys of 1) Quest, 2) Love, 3) Understanding, 4) Independence and Detachment, 5) Unity, 6) Astonishment and Bewilderment, and 7) Deprivation and Death. Love is discussed all around the poem, but we can start looking into Attar’s account of Love by discussing the passage of the birds through the Valley of Love.</p> <blockquote> <p>Next comes the Valley of Love. Walk here and drown in fire, for in this valley only fire lives. If you are not a lover of fire, then leave, because a true lover is one with fire; a true lover ignities, burns and flares like fire. […] Here, a lover joyfully gathers and throws a hunder worlds into the fire. Here, right and wrong are mates, because in love two becomes one.</p> </blockquote> <p>Love occupies a central place in Sufism, it’s the most noble pursuit of mankind, but also the most dangerous and difficult one. The above quote clearly exemplifies this — love is fire, with its danger, high spirit, and beauty. It’s also clear that, just like in Tolstoy, true love forces us to forgo reason. However one must note an important nuance — the love mentioned in the previous quote is the love of the Beloved, the Almighty — God. The quest to find God’s love and give all love to God is the most important pursuit in life in Sufism and Attar’s text.</p> <p>What about the love of other things? “Earthly things”. Attar is quite clear on the topic: nothing compares to the love of God, and anything that is not the love of God is not worthy of one’s time, but also doomed to vanish with time. For example, one chapter is dedicated to the story of a bird whose love of gold made him hesitant to embark on the quest to find God, he had all the happiness he needed in the gold he already had. The sage Hoopoe bird answers “Gold is merely a metal with a nice hue — you’re seduced by its color like a child. If gold diverts you from your Beloved, then it is an idol; throw it aside and be on the ground.” No surprises there, of course a spiritual text will warn one against the love of gold and material things. But what about the love people around you?</p> <p>A long parable tells the story of a sage (Sheik) who falls in love with a young Christian woman, so much that he abandons his faith to convert to Christianity, accepts to bow before an idol (the worst sin in Islam), eats swine, and drunk wine, all to please and seduce the woman he fell in love with. His earthly love completely corrupted him out of his faith, forced him to cease all his spiritual duties and abandon all his followers. While the love was strong, sincere, and “pure”, the Sheikh not only lost reason but at no point found true fulfillment, satisfaction, and peace which he had when in love and devoted to the Almighty.</p> <blockquote> <p>“In love’s wilderness, slaughter the swine, burn the idol or else become like the luckless sheik, disgraced in love”</p> </blockquote> <p>In the end, in Attar’s world, any “earthly” love is idolatry, and while not necessarily considered sinful in Islam, is clearly regarded as perilous and leads to the loss of the self and of The Way. The purest and only love that must be given is love to the Almighty.</p> <h2 id="so-what-do-tolstoy-and-attar-agree-on">So what do Tolstoy and Attar agree on?</h2> <p>Earthly love is fire, and won’t bring any human to supreme peace and happiness. Reaching God is human’s best chance at finding everlasting peace. However, the perceptions of the paths to God are very different for Attar and Tolstoy, and this is what I find most interesting. Tolstoy is, especially at the end of his life, clear on the idea that chastity and celibacy (and essentially, renunciation of all other earthly pleasures) are the only way to reach a stable and trouble-free, elevated life. Attar and the philosophy of Sufism are much more forgiving, and narrate countless stories of kings and peasants who have fallen into the trap of earthly love (or other “egocentric” and “earthly” traps), but every time, forgiveness is possible as long as the true search continues and the soul remains pure and honest. The search for God remains the purest of quests, and the one most likely to find peace in. It is also a source of great struggle, but these struggles, as opposed to the love of earthly things, are not caused by the source of Love itself (e.g. God), but rather by the earthly distractions of it all which corrupt the soul along The Way.</p> <p>While the path to an elevated life is very obvious and clear for Tolstoy, the search rarely ever ends for Sufis — finding God is the quest of a lifetime, and this will, exactly like the love of earthly things, come with its fair deal of struggles.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="open"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone asked him: “Distraught fellow, what is this love?” The man replied: “Love is selling all of your wordly goods to buy a drop of wine.”]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a post with jupyter notebook</title><link href="https://www.yassine.fyi/blog/jupyter-notebook/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a post with jupyter notebook"/><published>2023-07-04T12:57:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-04T12:57:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yassine.fyi/blog/jupyter-notebook</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yassine.fyi/blog/jupyter-notebook/"><![CDATA[<p>To include a jupyter notebook in a post, you can use the following code:</p> <div class="language-liquid highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{::nomarkdown}

This was an incredibly intense and enriching experience for me, on both a musical and a human level. However it was also quasi-traumatic as the rehearsals were very difficult, and I felt like I was to blame for it. As the concerts went relatively well, I now feel more at peace with all of the hardship and I managed to reflect on all the things I learned. Things I had never really realized during my conducting training. This essay is an attempt to share these lessons, and hopefully save fellow starting conductors from doing the same mistakes I did.</p> <p>When I first stood in front of an orchestra rehearsing for a real concert, I had already taken multiple conducting masterclasses. During these masterclasses, we explored the depth of a given score and thought deeply about how to reshape the standard beating patterns in order to shine light on the inner intricacies of the music, and make it live. This is what all conducting classes are about: you learn the technique and study the score in order to create beautiful music, exactly like playing an instrument. The issue with this is that it often makes the student forget something of critical importance: the sound doesn’t come from your waving, it comes from the orchestra.</p> <p><em>Conducting classes teach you how to act, but the conductor’s job is mostly about how to react.</em></p> <p>Standing in front of an orchestra while preparing for a concert made me realize I completely overlooked this critical part. If you are leading the Berlin Philharmonic on a piece that they already know by heart, the way you wave matters enormously. If that’s not the case, it’s only a small part of what it takes to produce decent (I would not dare say “good”) music. In this short essay, I’ll attempt to outline a few critical lessons I learned about conducting an orchestra, all originating from this key realization.</p> <h2 id="the-conductors-first-job-listenning">The conductor’s first job: Listenning</h2> <p>I did hear this from my conducting professors, but I never realized the extent of the job this was, nor how challenging it was. It’s not about perfect pitch, relative pitch, or any of that. It’s about listening to a given excerpt of music, played for the first (or tenth) time by some musicians, integrating all of what is happening, and pinpointing exactly what is wrong. On the spot. Are the second violins playing too loud? Is that third desk viola player badly out of tune and messing up the whole sound texture? Is the oboe (who’s playing rather unimportant harmony notes) actually one bar late because he has wrong bar numbers, cannot count, or (most probably), because you forgot to give them an appropriate cue? All of these at once? A myriad of different problems can (and do) occur while rehearsing, and your job as a conductor is to immediately identify what the problem is, and find a way to fix it (if it even is fixable in the short rehearsal time you have). Spoiler alert, you won’t master this by attending conducting masterclasses. The only way to get there is by doing, and by doing I mean making a fool of yourself in front of the orchestra a few times. I’ll try to spare you some problems by telling you some of the things I learned about rehearsal preparation during a traumatic two rehearsals.</p> <h3 id="do-not-overthinkg-your-conducting-during-rehearsals">Do not overthinkg your conducting during rehearsals</h3> <p>I imagine this to be a first-timer classic mistake. You’re so focused on what you’re doing, and wondering if you’re doing it right, that you forget the golden rule: it’s as much about reacting as acting. You should arrive to your first rehearsal with the basics completely integrated within you, in such a way that you don’t need to think about them. These basics are:</p> <ul> <li>Clear start of the pieces.</li> <li>Clear ideas of tempo.</li> <li>Important cues.</li> <li>Important dynamics.</li> </ul> <p>That’s it. It isn’t much, right? But if you’re an apprentice conductor going in front of an orchestra that has never played a piece before, that’s all you need to worry about for your first rehearsal. If you don’t have this properly integrated into your first rehearsal, you won’t manage to do your job properly, because you’ll be reading the music with them and thinking about your own waving instead of listening. You should also note that the musicians will mostly be reading (likely even discovering) the music, and thus cannot be very reactive to your waving’s “subtleties”. Focus on giving a clear and simple beating, <em>nothing</em> more than what they need to play.</p> <p>There will be mistakes on your part (and on theirs too). There will be things where you feel like you didn’t show the music properly etc… This does not matter at the beginning — you can work on these things in your own time between the rehearsal(s) and the concert. What you cannot work on in between is what the orchestra is doing, and whether there are significant problems.</p> <p>Your job during the rehearsal is to step back and actually listen to what is happening, and take decisions accordingly.</p> <h3 id="know-every-line-including-the-ones-that-dont-matter-a-lot-because-theyre-the-ones-that-actually-will-fuck-up-the-music">Know every line, including the ones that don’t matter a lot, because they’re the ones that actually will fuck up the music.</h3> <p>I was conducting the introduction of the first movement of Mozart’s K466 piano concerto, and the first violins and cellos/double bass have the important lines while the seconds/violas are “only” doubling. I was putting all my brain power into conducting/listening to the firsts violins and the cellos — this made me very very slow at realizing that the core of the problem was that seconds and violas were playing too loud and barely managing the not-so-obvious syncopation. You’d think that this is an obvious thing to realize (if I had heard it from the outside, it 100% is), but it isn’t when you’re on the spot, partly focusing on your own way of conducting, and when there are many other things going on. Of course, what first and cellos are playing is not perfect and can be improved to fit the exact idea of the music you have, but you have an ongoing disaster happening on other instruments that are, when you studied the score, only playing “repeated doubling notes”. By the time you realize, precious minutes of rehearsal time have passed, and you’re never getting this time again. In the end, these lines are also very important because they build the overall sound texture.</p> <p>My conclusion is that one should spend a lot of time studying the inner notes, training yourself to hear them in recordings for example, or playing them on the piano, or anything else that would work in order to make you very quick at spotting things that are wrong when they are wrong.</p> <p>Music is a holistic experience, all individual components have to be good in order for the whole to be good. Conductors should never forget that.</p> <h3 id="deconstruct-the-music-and-rehearse-it-as-such">Deconstruct the music, and rehearse it as such.</h3> <p>It is very helpful to deconstruct the music when rehearsing and make subgroups of instruments play sections together. Of course, it is the conductor’s job to have everyone really playing together, essentially acting like everyone else’s ear, but it is extremely helpful to have the players’ ears also in use, and when there is a lot happening, it’s difficult to have that happen. Choose groups of players playing correlated lines, and rehearse them together — not only will they get better at playing these lines, but it will also be extremely helpful for the conductor to correct issues (as fewer instruments are playing, and there is a point of focus that is being looked upon). As long as you don’t spend too long doing this, it will also be useful to musicians not playing as they identify and internalize important parts of the whole piece rather than only their own parts. But please don’t ever spend too long doing that with all the orchestra there, they’ll hate you for it.</p> <h2 id="the-conductors-second-job-leading">The conductor’s second job: Leading</h2> <p>Some may argue that you’re either born with it, or you’re not. I’ve always thought of myself as someone who could lead people, and motivate them towards a common vision. I was proven wrong this time — big time. Leading an orchestra is nothing like what I’ve experienced before. Very rare are the people with the necessary self-confidence, musicianship, knowledge, and humanity to do this job properly. I realized it was far from given to me, and that I had to grow a lot as a musician and human to ever hope to do this well.</p> <h3 id="yes-youre-leading-but-dont-make-it-about-yourself-no-one-is-bigger-than-the-music">Yes, you’re leading, but don’t make it about yourself. No one is bigger than the music.</h3> <p>Musicians are there to play, as much as you are there to conduct. You’re the leader, but don’t ever make them feel like you are in the slightest way more important than they are. As a leader, you should also take the necessary initiatives to make them feel valued and listened to. Small things like putting their bios on a concert program, smiling at them when they have an important line to play (even if it’s not played perfectly!), or the way you make them stand after a concert… This all makes a significant difference, and can ultimately make them truly happy to play for you — or should I say, to play with you. This is what I mean by “no one is bigger than the music“— do not act or think that the musicians are playing for you, they’re playing with you. You’re all together trying to create beautiful music — this shift in attitude is so important to make the whole process, from rehearsals to concerts, more enjoyable and less stressful for everyone. And if everyone enjoys themselves, the music will be the best it can be.</p> <h3 id="managing-issues">Managing issues</h3> <p>Experience is the only way here. You learn the kind of issues that arise and are used to dealing with them. You thus prepare accordingly and have a better ability to deal with them on the spot. It will be difficult and stressful the first few times — there is nothing more terrifying than a musician asking you a question in front of the whole orchestra and you not having a clue of how to answer. I’ve been in this situation multiple times during the rehearsals, and what I often did was to tell them I wasn’t sure and that I’d think about it for the next rehearsal or that I’d let them know before the concert. It’s really really suboptimal, but that’s the only way I found to deal with it without losing rehearsal time and frustrating everyone with my own shortcomings. It takes a lot of experience to be able to look at a score and figure out complex things on the spot — experience that I do not yet have.</p> <p>There are other schools of thought, which can also work. I once heard: “if you’re asked about something and don’t know how to answer, just pick an answer that sounds acceptable, and act confident. If you then realize it doesn’t work, just say you’ve changed your mind”. For most people, this will sound like horrible advice. “One must know its limits and when they don’t know something”. Absolutely, but not in front of an orchestra. For a conductor, there is really nothing worse than not being able to answer a musician’s concerns. It not only stresses you out but also makes you look unprepared. And musicians are quick to judge…</p> <h3 id="managing-motivation">Managing motivation</h3> <p>I experienced a massive issue with this on the second (and last) concert of the series. We all had to travel for more than 2 hours to get to the venue, mainly because of a railway strike in London… The public turnout was also very disappointing. We arrived early and rehearsed things that were not great on concert 1, and it felt like everyone was much better prepared than at the previous concert, and things looked promising. The first half went quite okay, with some good moments. During the interval, I made the terrible mistake of going to the first violinist and first viola players (the most experienced players in the group) seeking reassurance and encouragement about the first half, before starting the second. I was not sensing much satisfaction at all from their ends. Digging a bit deeper and asking more, the first viola player finally said “I don’t know, it’s like musicians know the music and have played it already, we’re all a bit tired, so it feels like no one is very motivated to play. There isn’t much energy”. This threw me off so much, and whilst there was some truth to it regarding the first half, the second half felt 10 times worse. Why? Well because I was now over-sensing the lack of motivation, which unmotivated me as well and of course made it impossible to generate any excitement from the players. Imagine - as devoted to music as I am, as privileged as I felt to be in front of an orchestra playing the incredible Mozart k466, I still had the feeling that nothing good could possibly come out of this performance anymore.</p> <p>This was a very traumatic experience for me because I did not expect it and handled it so badly. Whatever happens, however bad the music has been in the previous minutes, the conductor should ALWAYS give their all when performing. Not communicating good energy when conducting is simply deadly for the performance, there cannot be a gram of passion from the players if the conductor is visibly unmotivated. The conductor is obliged to at least fake it. Fake motivation, fake excitement, until you make it in the eyes of only one musician. From that one musician, the whole group’s excitement can progressively regrow. Never stop smiling, always act as if you’re the happiest person in the world to be playing this music, no matter what — this will make all the difference in the world.</p> <h3 id="knowing-your-players">Knowing your players</h3> <p>“<em>Be aware of what you are rehearsing, and what you are not rehearsing</em>”. This is one of the many important pieces of advice I heard from my incredibly erudite professor, John Longstaff. A conductor should be very clearly aware of the musical level of the players in the orchestra, and of the time you have to rehearse. Sometimes, you should (unfortunately) only aim for decency, rather than goodness. In these moments, don’t lose time rehearsing the fine details of that beautiful line, spend time making sure that everyone is playing together and that all the difficult passages are clear, at a playable tempo, and that all notes can be heard. Musicians won’t be happy staying over the agreed time, they have other things to do and they get tired as well.</p> <h3 id="being-mindful-of-players-needs">Being mindful of player’s needs</h3> <p>Understand what they need, for their mental sanity, confidence, and motivation. Make sure you give them that. If you’re reading this far, you’re most likely a starting conductor, and I guess you’ll have to do the librarian work as well to prepare scores, etc… This is SO important — make sure all their parts are readable, well organized, that page turns are acceptable, etc… Give them clear indications to last minute adjustments in the music, what repeats you are playing / not playing, etc… I’d even go as far as saying you should put all of it in writing for the players not to get confused on concert day. Just imagine how terrifying it would be for you not to be 100% sure whether the conductor told you to play the repeat or not. This can happen so easily when making last-minute changes… Stupid issues like this are so easy to avoid if the conductor just tries a bit harder. Handling this well is a great way to earn your player’s respect, and failing to do so will inevitably make players hate you…</p> <hr/> <p>These humble thoughts are only a tiny aspect of what could and should be discussed about the colossal job of the conductor. What an irony that the only musician which doesn’t produce any sound bares so much responsibility.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="open"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I had the chance to organize and lead a concert series in London where we played Britten’s Simple Symphony, Mozart Divertimento k136 in D Major, and a strings-only arrangement of Mozart’s Concerto k466 in D minor (with the fantastic Adam Heron on the Piano). This was an incredibly intense and enriching experience for me, on both a musical and a human level. However it was also quasi-traumatic as the rehearsals were very difficult, and I felt like I was to blame for it. As the concerts went relatively well, I now feel more at peace with all of the hardship and I managed to reflect on all the things I learned. Things I had never really realized during my conducting training. This essay is an attempt to share these lessons, and hopefully save fellow starting conductors from doing the same mistakes I did.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a distill-style blog post</title><link href="https://www.yassine.fyi/blog/distill/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a distill-style blog post"/><published>2021-05-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-05-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yassine.fyi/blog/distill</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yassine.fyi/blog/distill/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="equations">Equations</h2> <p>This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax 3</a> engine. You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p> <p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p> \[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\] <p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="citations">Citations</h2> <p>Citations are then used in the article body with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-cite&gt;</code> tag. The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography. The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.</p> <p>The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p> <p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag.

For larger blocks of code, add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block</code> attribute:</p> <d-code block="" language="javascript"> var x = 25; function(x) { return x * x; } </d-code> <p><strong>Note:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code&gt;</code> blocks do not look good in the dark mode.

You must indent your code by <strong>(3 * bullet_indent_level)</strong> spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">1.</span> We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
<span class="p">
   1.</span> Like this:<span class="sb">

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

</span><span class="p">   2.</span> The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Which displays:</p> <ol> <li> <p>We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Like this:</p> <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">);</span>

If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers</code> to true in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.</p> <p>If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:</p> <p>{% highlight c++ linenos %} <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}</p> <p>The keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linenos</code> triggers display of line numbers.
