        <h1>To-Do-List</h1>
        <p>A list of stuff I want to add to the website. Purposely leaving it public for the memes and also in the hope that someone cares enough to bully me into adding them.</p> 
    </div>

<br />

- [ ] Add a "My Friends On The News" section to brag about the achievements of my friends.
- [ ] Add a "Favourite Quotes" section, to make public some of my friends' outrageous/brilliant quotes and some important quotes I like as well - but who cares about those.  
- [ ] Expand the "Internet Favourites" section, and most importantly, enable users to sort by Tag, or maybe by date at which I added it. I think this would be cool if the section gets bigger. 
- [ ] Add a full CV. To be honest I'm not quite sure I want to do that. Maybe I will. Let's see. 
- [ ] Add the blog posts from Medium into the website. Ideally, add a comment section. 
- [ ] Find a way to automatically retrieve the latest book reviews from GoodReads. Though honeslty I'll never do this I think. 
- [ ] Add some music to the blog.
